<h4><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h4>


<p>With the end of the century there has come in France a
great revival of the struggle between religion and free thought
which has so long been waged there; and the stupendous effort
put forth by the Roman Catholic Church to annihilate the
Third Republic has placed the country in a condition of unrest
such as it has only known on the eve of its chief Revolutions.
Behind the notorious Dreyfus case, behind the shouts
of 'Long live the army!' and 'Death to the Jews!' behind
all the so-called Nationalism and Militarism, the Church has
been steadily, incessantly working, ever fanning the flames of
discord, ever promoting and fostering coalitions of malcontents,
by whose help it hopes to recover its old-time paramountcy.
Time alone can reveal the outcome of this great effort, this
'forlorn hope' assault upon institutions which have hitherto
kept Catholicism in check and tended so largely to the diffusion
of free thought; but personally I am inclined to think,
with all due allowance for partial successes achieved here and
there, that this Clerical movement, however skilfully engineered
under the cloak of patriotism, and however lavishly
financed by the bulk of the money derived from the Lourdes
'miracles,' over which the Assumptionist Fathers preside,
and the offerings of zealots throughout the country, will
ultimately result in failure, for France is not at heart a
religious country, and when faith has departed from a nation
can it be restored?</p>

<p>The meaning of the Clerical movement to which I have
referred is twofold. In the first place there is the perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
natural and legitimate desire of the French Catholics to
recover lost ascendancy; and in the second place there is the
conviction of the Vatican and the French episcopate generally
that France is the only country which under favourable circumstances
might be in a position to restore the temporal
power of the Holy See. In that respect the Pope can hope
for nothing from Spain or Austria or the Catholic States of
Germany. In France rests the sole hope of the Papacy; and
thus on political as well as religious grounds the establishment
of a Catholic <i>régime</i> in place of the present-day free-thought
Republic is the one great dream of those who direct
the fortunes of the Holy Roman and Apostolic Church.</p>

<p>All who know anything of modern history are aware that
in 1849 a French army overthrew the Roman Republic and
reinstated Pius IX. in possession of the so-called patrimony
of St. Peter, and that in after years, until France indeed was
vanquished at Sedan, the presence of French forces alone
enabled the Pope to continue in the exercise of his territorial
sway. Both the Royalist reactionaries who sat in the National
Assembly of the Second Republic, and the Prince-President
of that time, afterwards Napoleon III., lent support to
Pius IX., and in return expected to receive the countenance
and help of the French clergy in their various designs upon
France. But the clergy always seeks its own ends, and more
than once its policy varied, now being in favour of the
Royalists and now in favour of Louis Napoleon, according
as it seemed likely to secure greater benefits from one or the
other.</p>

<p>Even when the contest for supremacy was over, when the
Republic had been murdered at the Coup d'État, and the
hopes of the Count de Chambord had been destroyed by the
triumph of Napoleon the Little, the clergy did not give unqualified
support to the new government. True, on the 1st of
January, 1852, Monseigneur Sibour, Archbishop of Paris,
officiated at a solemn 'Te Deum' at Notre Dame in honour
of the triumph of a bribed and drunken soldiery over the
defenders of the Constitution; but Louis Napoleon had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
scarcely become Emperor before a large section of the clergy
began to protest that the new <i>régime</i> was by no means sufficiently
Clerical. The course adopted in these circumstances
was very characteristic and significant. An education law
had been passed in 1850, giving many privileges and advantages
to the clergy, such indeed as they had not possessed
since the downfall of Charles X. But comparative liberty in
educational matters was more than the French episcopate,
eager for domination as the price of its adhesion to imperialism,
could willingly allow, and before long a celebrated and remarkably
well written newspaper, 'L'Univers,' initiated a
campaign against the Empire, taking as its standpoint that
the Pope was the virtual sovereign of the world, and that
everything must be subservient to the interests of the Roman
Church. Half the French episcopate actively supported the
view which followed, <i>i.e.</i> that the education of the young
ought to be entirely under priestly control, the priests being
the vicars of the Pope, even as he (the Pope) was the vicar of
the Deity. There were some curious and even amusing incidents
in the course of that now forgotten campaign. For
instance, it was actually proposed to abolish the study of the
Greek and Latin classics in France, a suggestion which many
of the Bishops vigorously upheld, though others of a scholarly
turn pleaded plaintively in favour of Horace and a few others,
whose writings, if edited in a Christian spirit, might yet, they
thought, be allowed among young men of proved morality!</p>

<p>With the educational controversy many political matters
soon became blended. The Italian revolutionaries were at
that time doing their utmost to frighten Napoleon III. into
fulfilment of his early promises respecting the liberation of
Italy; and the Vatican, anxious for the maintenance of the
old order of things, since any change must help on its own
fall, made desperate efforts to prevent the interference of
France in Italian affairs, unless indeed it were for the consolidation
of the Papal power. Even as in recent times the
Assumptionist Fathers have intrigued for the overthrow of
the Third Republic, so did the Société de St. Vincent de Paul&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
nominally was a mere charitable organisation&mdash;seek
to turn the Empire into a priestly <i>régime</i>, or in default thereof
to overthrow it. The position of Napoleon III. was the more
difficult since his own wife, the Empress Eugénie, acted as
the Vatican's spy and agent. Matters at last reached such a
pass that the Emperor's Minister, Billault, had on the one
hand to prohibit political allusions in sermons, under pain of
fine and imprisonment, and on the other to break up and
scatter the intriguing religious societies. Nevertheless the
Empire's position remained a difficult one to the very last,
and Napoleon III. was often sorely puzzled how to steer a
safe course between the claims of the Pope and the clergy
and the aspirations of Italy and its well-wishers; to say
nothing of the views of all those who, thinking of France
alone, by no means approved of priestly power in politics.</p>

<p>It is on the state of affairs to which I have alluded, the
hostility of a part of the French clergy to the Empire in its
earlier years, that M. Zola has based his novel, 'The Conquest
of Plassans.' The priests, subservient to the Vatican, lead
the town into a course of opposition against imperial institutions,
and the Government then despatches thither an impecunious
and unscrupulous priest, one Abbé Faujas, for the
purpose of winning it back again. Such tactics were not
infrequently employed at that time. Whilst a part of the
clergy simply followed its own inclinations, others venally
took pay from the Empire to do its dirty work. As often as
not they subsequently betrayed their paymaster, using the
positions into which they were thrust for the satisfaction of
their personal ambition. Still, for a while these needy
hangers-on at the Ministry of Public Worship proved useful
allies, and the Empire was only too ready to employ them.
It will be seen, then, that the theme chosen by M. Zola rests
upon historical fact, and it may be taken that his story embodies
incidents which actually occurred under such conditions
as those that I have described.</p>

<p>The 'Conquest of Plassans' may well be read in conjunction
with 'The Fortune of the Rougons,' M. Zola's earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
work, as the scene in both instances is the same, and certain
personages, such as Félicité Rougon and Antoine Macquart,
figure largely in both books. In the earlier volume we see
the effect of the Coup d'État in the provinces, almost every
incident being based upon historical fact. For instance,
Miette, the heroine of 'The Fortune of the Rougons,' had a
counterpart in Madame Ferrier, that being the real name of
the young woman who, carrying the insurgents' blood-red
banner, was hailed by them as the 'Goddess of Liberty' on
their dramatic march. And in like way the tragic death of
Silvère, linked to another hapless prisoner, was founded by
M. Zola on an incident that followed the rising, as recorded
by an eyewitness.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Amidst all the bloodshed, the Rougons,
in M. Zola's narrative, rise to fortune and power, and Plassans
(really Aix-en-Provence) bows down before them. But time
passes, the revolt of the clergy supervenes, by their influence
the town chooses a Royalist Marquis as deputy, and it becomes
necessary to conquer it once again.</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas, by whom this conquest is achieved on behalf
of the Empire, is, I think, a strongly conceived character,
perhaps the most real of all the priests that are scattered
through M. Zola's books. I do not say this because he
happens to be anything but a good man. M. Zola has
sketched more than one good priest in his novels, as, for
instance, Abbé Rose in 'Paris;' but in this one, Faujas, there
is more genuine flesh and blood than in all the others. True,
his colleagues, Bourrette and Fenil, are admirably suggested;
the Bishop, too, an indolent prelate who surrenders the
government of his diocese to his vicar-general, and spends
his time in translating Horace (for he is one of the few who
favour the classics), leaves on one an impression of reality;
yet no other priestly creation of M. Zola's pen can to my
thinking vie with the stern, chaste, authoritative, ambitious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
Faujas, the man who subdues Plassans, and who wrecks the
home of the Mouret family, with whom he lives.</p>

<p>Leading parts in the story are assigned to Mouret and his
wife Marthe, both of whom are extremely interesting figures.
The genesis of the former's career and fate is contained in
one of M. Zola's short stories, 'Histoire d'un Fou,' which he
contributed to the Paris 'Événement' before he took to book
writing. The idea, so skilfully worked out, is that of a man
who, although perfectly sane, is generally believed to be mad,
and who by force of being thus regarded does ultimately lose
his wits. In Marthe his wife, the grand-daughter of a mad
woman, we find the hereditary flaw turning to hysteria, in a
measure of a religious character, such as subsequently becomes
manifest in her son Serge, the chief character of 'Abbé
Mouret's Transgression,' which work proceeds directly from
'The Conquest of Plassans.'</p>

<p>In the latter book, as in 'The Fortune of the Rougons,'
M. Zola skilfully depicts all the life of a French provincial
town such as it was half a century or so ago, and in this
respect he has simply drawn upon his own recollections of
Aix, where he spent so many years of his boyhood. Much
that he records might be applied to such towns even nowadays,
for electric lighting, and tramcars, and motor-cars, and
increased railway facilities, have made little change in provincial
society. There are still rival <i>salons</i> and <i>coteries</i> and
petty jealousies and vanities all at work; and if new parties
have succeeded old ones, their intrigues have remained of much
the same description as formerly. The many provincials
who in M. Zola's narrative gravitate around the chief
characters are pleasantly and skilfully diversified, and seem
very life-like with their foibles and 'fads' and rivalries and
ambitions. Possibly the most interesting are the Paloques,
husband and wife, whom envy, hatred and all uncharitableness
incessantly consume. Again, Madame Faujas, the priest's
mother, is a finely-drawn character, but perhaps the failings
of her daughter Olympe, and of Trouche, Olympe's husband,
verge slightly upon caricature. As for old Rose, the Mourets'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
servant, though her ways are very amusing, and the part she
plays in the persecution of her master renders her an indispensable
personage in the narrative, it may be pointed out that she
is virtually the same woman who has done duty half a dozen
times in M. Zola's books&mdash;for instance, as Martine in 'Dr.
Pascal,' as Véronique in 'The Joy of Life,' and so forth. It
is rather curious, indeed, that M. Zola, so skilful in portraying
diversity of character and disposition among his other
personages, should have clung so pertinaciously to one sole
type of an old servant-woman.</p>

<p>It is not my purpose here to analyse in detail the plot of
'The Conquest of Plassans,' but, having dealt at some length
with the historical incidents on which the work is based, it is
as well that I should point out that politics are not obtruded
upon the reader in M. Zola's pages. Indeed, the book largely
deals with quite another matter, that of 'the priest in the
house,' showing as it does how the Mourets' home was
wrecked by the combined action of the Faujases and the
Trouches. In this connection the dolorous career of the
unhappy Marthe is very vividly pictured. A fairly contented
wife and mother at the outset of the story, she is won over
to religion by Faujas, whose purpose is to utilise her as an
instrument for the furtherance of his political and social
schemes. But religion for her becomes a mysticism full of
unrealisable yearnings, for she expects to taste the joys of
Heaven even upon earth. Carried away by her religious
fervour, she soon neglects her home; and her husband, it
must be admitted, takes anything but the right course to
win her back. She begins to loathe him and to indulge in
an insane passion for the priest by whom she is spurned.
Then hysteria masters her and consumption sets in; and
between them those fell diseases bring her to an early grave.
There are some finely conceived scenes between Marthe and
Faujas; but the climax only comes towards the end of the
volume, when Mouret, the husband who has been driven mad
and shut up in a lunatic asylum, returns home and wreaks the
most terrible vengeance upon those who have wronged him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
The pages which deal with the madman's escape and his
horrible revenge are certainly among the most powerful that
M. Zola has ever written, and have been commended for their
effectiveness by several of his leading critics.</p>

<h3>THE CONQUEST OF PLASSANS</h3>

<hr class="r5" />
<h3>I</h3>


<p>Désirée clapped her hands. She was fourteen years old and
big and strong for her age, but she laughed like a little girl
of five.</p>

<p>'Mother! mother!' she cried, 'look at my doll!'</p>

<p>She showed her mother a strip of rag out of which she
had been trying for the last quarter of an hour to manufacture
a doll by rolling it and tying it at one end with a piece
of string. Marthe raised her eyes from the stockings that
she was darning with as much delicacy of work as though she
were embroidering, and smiled at Désirée.</p>

<p>'Oh! but that's only a baby,' she said; 'you must
make a grown-up doll and it must have a dress, you know,
like a lady.'</p>

<p>She gave the child some clippings of print stuff which she
found in her work-table, and then again devoted all her
attention to her stockings. They were both sitting at one
end of the narrow terrace, the girl on a stool at her mother's
feet. The setting sun of a still warm September evening cast
its calm peaceful rays around them; and the garden below,
which was already growing grey and shadowy, was wrapped
in perfect silence. Outside, not a sound could be heard in
that quiet corner of the town.</p>

<p>They both worked on for ten long minutes without speaking.
Désirée was taking immense pains to make a dress for
her doll. Every few moments Marthe raised her head and
glanced at the child with an expression in which sadness was
mingled with affection. Seeing that the girl's task seemed
too much for her, she at last said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>'Give it to me. I will put in the sleeves for you.'</p>

<p>As she took up the doll, two big lads of seventeen and
eighteen came down the steps. They ran to Marthe and
kissed her.</p>

<p>'Don't scold us, mother!' cried Octave gaily. 'I took
Serge to listen to the band. There was such a crowd on the
Cours Sauvaire!'</p>

<p>'I thought you had been kept in at college,' his mother
said, 'or I should have felt very uneasy.'</p>

<p>Désirée, now altogether indifferent to her doll, had thrown
her arms round Serge's neck, saying to him:</p>

<p>'One of my birds has flown away! The blue one, the one
you gave me!'</p>

<p>She was on the point of crying. Her mother, who had
imagined this trouble to be forgotten, vainly tried to divert
her thoughts by showing her the doll. The girl still clung
to her brother's arm and dragged him away with her, while
repeating:</p>

<p>'Come and let us look for it.'</p>

<p>Serge followed her with kindly complaisance and tried to
console her. She led him to a little conservatory, in front
of which there was a cage placed on a stand; and here she
told him how the bird had escaped just as she was opening
the door to prevent it from fighting with a companion.</p>

<p>'Well, there's nothing very surprising in that!' cried
Octave, who had seated himself on the balustrade of the
terrace. 'She is always interfering with them, trying to
find out how they are made and what it is they have in their
throats that makes them sing. The other day she was carrying
them about in her pockets the whole afternoon to keep
them warm.'</p>

<p>'Octave!' said Marthe, in a tone of reproach; 'don't
tease the poor child.'</p>

<p>But Désirée had not heard him; she was explaining to
Serge with much detail how the bird had flown away.</p>

<p>'It just slipped out, you see, like that, and then it flew
over yonder and lighted on Monsieur Rastoil's big pear-tree.
Next it flew off to the plum-tree at the bottom, came back
again and went right over my head into the big trees belonging
to the Sub-Prefecture, and I've never seen it since; no,
never since.'</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>'Perhaps it will come back again,' Serge ventured to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh! do you think so? I think I will put the others into
a box, and leave the door of the cage open all night.'</p>

<p>Octave could not restrain his laughter, but Marthe called
to Désirée:</p>

<p>'Come and look here! come and look here!'</p>

<p>Then she gave her the doll. It was a magnificent one
now. It had a stiff dress, a head made of a pad of calico,
and arms of list sewn on at the shoulders. Désirée's eyes
lighted up with sudden joy. She sat down again upon the
stool, and, forgetting all about the bird, began to kiss the doll
and dandle it in her arms with childish delight.</p>

<p>Serge had gone to lean upon the balustrade near his
brother, and Marthe had resumed her darning.</p>

<p>'And so the band has been playing, has it?' she asked.</p>

<p>'It plays every Thursday,' Octave replied. 'You ought
to have come to hear it, mother. All the town was there;
the Rastoil girls, Madame de Condamin, Monsieur Paloque,
the mayor's wife and daughter&mdash;why didn't you come too?'</p>

<p>Marthe did not raise her eyes, but softly replied as she
finished darning a hole:</p>

<p>'You know very well, my dears, that I don't care about
going out. I am quite contented here; and then it is necessary
that someone should stay with Désirée.'</p>

<p>Octave opened his lips to reply, but he glanced at his sister
and kept silent. He remained where he was, whistling softly
and raising his eyes now towards the trees of the Sub-Prefecture,
noisy with the twittering of the sparrows which were
preparing to retire for the night&mdash;and now towards Monsieur
Rastoil's pear-trees behind which the sun was setting. Serge
had taken a book out of his pocket and was reading it attentively.
Soft silence brooded over the terrace as it lay there in
the yellow light that was gradually growing fainter. Marthe
continued darning, ever and anon glancing at her three
children in the peaceful quiet of the evening.</p>

<p>'Everyone seems to be late to-day,' she said after a time.
'It is nearly six o'clock, and your father hasn't come home
yet. I think he must have gone to Les Tulettes.'</p>

<p>'Oh! then, no wonder he's late!' exclaimed Octave.
'The peasants at Les Tulettes are never in a hurry to let him
go when once they get hold of him. Has he gone there to
buy some wine?'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' Marthe replied. 'He isn't fond, you know,
of talking to me about his business.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there was another interval of silence. In the
dining-room, the window of which opened on to the terrace,
old Rose had just begun to lay the table with much angry
clattering of crockery and plate. She seemed to be in a very
bad temper, and banged the chairs about while breaking into
snatches of grumbling and growling. At last she went to
the street door, and, craning out her head, reconnoitred the
square in front of the Sub-Prefecture. After some minutes'
waiting, she came to the terrace-steps and cried:</p>

<p>'Monsieur Mouret isn't coming home to dinner, then?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Rose, wait a little longer,' Marthe replied quietly.</p>

<p>'Everything is getting burned to cinders! There's no
sense in it all. When master goes off on those rounds he
ought to give us notice! Well, it's all the same to me; but
your dinner will be quite uneatable.'</p>

<p>'Ah! do you really think so, Rose?' asked a quiet voice
just behind her. 'We will eat it, notwithstanding.'</p>

<p>It was Mouret who had just arrived.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Rose turned
round, looked her master in the face, and seemed on the point
of breaking into some angry exclamation; but at the sight of
his unruffled countenance, in which twinkled an expression of
merry banter, she could not find a word to say, and so she
retired. Mouret made his way to the terrace, where he paced
about without sitting down. He just tapped Désirée lightly
on the cheek with the tips of his fingers, and the girl greeted
him with a responsive smile. Marthe raised her eyes, and
when she had glanced at her husband she began to fold up
her work.</p>

<p>'Aren't you tired?' asked Octave, looking at his father's
boots, which were white with dust.</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed, a little,' Mouret replied, without, however,
saying anything more about the long journey which he had
just made on foot.</p>

<p>Then in the middle of the garden he caught sight of a
spade and a rake, which the children had forgotten there.</p>

<p>'Why are the tools not put away?' he cried. 'I have
spoken about it a hundred times. If it should come on to
rain they would be completely rusted and spoilt.'</p>

<p>He said no more on the subject, but stepped down into the
garden, picked up the spade and rake himself, and put them
carefully away inside the little conservatory. As he came up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
to the terrace again his eyes searched every corner of the
walks to see if things were tidy there.</p>

<p>'Are you learning your lessons?' he asked, as he passed
Serge, who was still poring over his book.</p>

<p>'No, father,' the boy replied; 'this is a book that Abbé
Bourrette has lent me. It is an account of the missions in
China.'</p>

<p>Mouret stopped short in front of his wife.</p>

<p>'By the way,' said he, 'has anyone been here?'</p>

<p>'No, no one, my dear,' replied Marthe with an appearance
of surprise.</p>

<p>He seemed on the point of saying something further, but
appeared to change his mind, and continued pacing up and
down in silence. Then, going to the steps, he cried out:</p>

<p>'Well, Rose, what about this dinner of yours which is
getting burnt to cinders?'</p>

<p>'Oh, indeed! there is nothing ready for you now!'
shouted the cook in an angry voice from the other end of
the passage. 'Everything is cold. You will have to wait,
sir.'</p>

<p>Mouret smiled in silence and winked with his left eye, as
he glanced at his wife and children. He seemed to be very
much amused by Rose's anger. Then he occupied himself
in examining his neighbour's fruit-trees.</p>

<p>'It is surprising what splendid pears Monsieur Rastoil
has got this year,' he remarked.</p>

<p>Marthe, who had appeared a little uneasy for the last few
minutes, seemed as though she wanted to say something. At
last she made up her mind to speak, and timidly inquired:</p>

<p>'Were you expecting someone to-day, my dear?'</p>

<p>'Yes and no,' he replied, beginning to pace the terrace
again.</p>

<p>'Perhaps you have let the second floor?'</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed, I have let it.'</p>

<p>Then, as the silence became a little embarrassing, he
added, in his quiet way:</p>

<p>'This morning, before starting for Les Tulettes, I went
up to see Abbé Bourrette. He was very pressing, and so I
agreed to his proposal. I know it won't please you; but, if
you will only think the matter over for a little, you will see
that you are wrong, my dear. The second floor was of no
use to us, and it was only going to ruin. The fruit that we
store in the rooms there brings on dampness which makes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
paper fall from the walls. By the way, now that I think of it,
don't forget to remove the fruit the first thing to-morrow.
Our tenant may arrive at any moment.'</p>

<p>'We were so free and comfortable, all alone in our own
house,' Marthe ventured to say, in a low tone.</p>

<p>'Oh, well!' replied Mouret, 'we shan't find a priest in
our way. He will keep to himself, and we shall keep to ourselves.
Those black-gowned gentlemen hide themselves when
they want to swallow even a glass of water. You know that
I'm not very partial to them myself. A set of lazybones for
the most part! And yet what chiefly decided me to let the
floor was that I had found a priest for a tenant. One is quite
sure of one's money with them, and they are so quiet that
one can't even hear them go in and out.'</p>

<p>Marthe still appeared distressed. She looked round her
at the happy home basking in the sun's farewell, at the
garden which was now growing greyer with shadows, and at
her three children. And she thought of all the happiness
which this little spot held for her.</p>

<p>'And do you know anything about this priest?'she asked.</p>

<p>'No; but Abbé Bourrette has taken the floor in his own
name, and that is quite sufficient. Abbé Bourrette is an
honourable man. I know that our tenant is called Faujas,
Abbé Faujas, and that he comes from the diocese of Besançon.
He didn't get on very well with his vicar there, and so he has
been appointed curate here at Saint-Saturnin's. Perhaps he
knows our bishop, Monseigneur Rousselot. But all this is no
business of ours, you know; and it is to Abbé Bourrette that
I am trusting in the whole matter.'</p>

<p>Marthe, however, did not seem to share her husband's
confidence, but continued to stand out against him, a thing
which seldom happened.</p>

<p>'You are right,' she said, after a moment's silence, 'Abbé
Bourrette is a worthy man. But I recollect that when he
came to look at the rooms he told me that he did not know
the name of the person on whose behalf he was commissioned
to rent them. It was one of those commissions which are
undertaken by priests in one town for those in another. I
really think that you ought to write to Besançon and make
some inquiries as to what sort of a person it is that you are
about to introduce into your house.'</p>

<p>Mouret was anxious to avoid losing his temper; he smiled
complacently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>'Well, it isn't the devil, anyhow. Why, you're trembling
all over! I didn't think you were so superstitious. You
surely don't believe that priests bring ill luck, as folks say.
Neither, of course, do they bring good luck. They are just
like other men. But, when we get this Abbé here, you'll see
if I'm afraid of his cassock!'</p>

<p>'No, I'm not superstitious; you know that quite well,'
replied Marthe. 'I only feel unhappy about it, that's all.'</p>

<p>He took his stand in front of her, and interrupted her with
a sharp motion of his hand.</p>

<p>'There! there! that will do,' said he. 'I have let the
rooms; don't let us say anything more about the matter.'</p>

<p>Then, in the bantering tones of a <i>bourgeois</i> who thinks he
has done a good stroke of business, he added:</p>

<p>'At any rate one thing is certain, and that is that I am to
get a hundred and fifty francs rent; and we shall have those
additional hundred and fifty francs to spend on the house
every year.'</p>

<p>Marthe bent her head and made no further protestations
except by vaguely swinging her hands and gently closing her
eyes as though to prevent the escape of the tears which were
already swelling beneath her eyelids. Then she cast a furtive
glance at her children, who had not appeared to hear anything
of her discussion with their father. They were, indeed,
accustomed to scenes of this sort in which Mouret, with his
bantering nature, delighted to indulge.</p>

<p>'You can come in now, if you would like something to
eat,' said Rose in her crabby voice, as she came to the
steps.</p>

<p>'Ah, that's right! Come along, children, to your soup!'
cried Mouret gaily, without appearing to retain any trace of
temper.</p>

<p>The whole family rose. But Désirée's grief seemed to revive
at the sight of everyone stirring. She threw her arms round
her father's neck and stammered:</p>

<p>'Oh, papa, one of my birds has flown away!'</p>

<p>'One of your birds, my dear? Well, we'll catch it again.'</p>

<p>Then he began to caress and fondle her, but she insisted
that he, also, should go and look at the cage. When he
brought her back again Marthe and her two sons were
already in the dining-room. The rays of the setting sun,
streaming in through the window, lighted up the porcelain
plates, the children's plated mugs, and the white cloth. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
room was warm and peaceful with its green background of
garden.</p>

<p>But just as Marthe, upon whom the tranquillity of the
scene had had a soothing effect, was smilingly removing the
cover from the soup-tureen, a noise was heard in the passage.</p>

<p>Then Rose rushed into the room with a scared look and
stammered:</p>

<p>'Monsieur l'Abbé Faujas has come!'</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="II" id="II">II</a></h3>


<p>An expression of annoyance passed over Mouret's face. He
had not expected his tenant till the following morning at the
earliest. He was just rising hastily from his seat when Abbé
Faujas himself appeared at the door. He was a tall big man,
with a square face, broad features, and a cadaverous complexion.
Behind him, in the shadow, stood an elderly
woman, who bore an astonishing resemblance to him, only
that she was of smaller build and wore a less refined expression.
When they saw the table laid for a meal, they both
hesitated and stepped back discreetly, though without going
away. The priest's tall black figure contrasted mournfully
with the cheerfulness of the whitewashed walls.</p>

<p>'We must ask your pardon for disturbing you,' he said to
Mouret. 'We have just left Abbé Bourrette's; he, no doubt,
gave you notice of our coming!'</p>

<p>'Not at all!' Mouret exclaimed. 'The Abbé never behaves
like other people. He always seems as though he had
just come down from paradise. Only this morning, sir, he
told me that you would not be here for another couple of
days. Well, we must put you in possession of your rooms all
the same.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas apologised. He spoke in a deep voice which
fell very softly at the end of each sentence. He was extremely
distressed, said he, to have arrived at such a moment.
And when he had expressed his regret in a very few
well-chosen words, he turned round to pay the porter who
had brought his trunk. His large well-shaped hands drew
from the folds of his cassock a purse of which only the steel
rings could be seen. Keeping his head bent, he cautiously
fumbled in it for a moment. Then, without anyone having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
seen the piece of money which he had received, the porter
went away, and the priest resumed in his refined way:</p>

<p>'I beg you, sir, sit down again. Your servant will show us
the rooms, and will help me to carry this.'</p>

<p>As he spoke, he stooped to grasp one of the handles of his
trunk. It was a small wooden trunk, bound at the edges with
iron bands, and one of its sides seemed to have been repaired
with a cross-piece of deal. Mouret looked surprised, and his
eyes wandered off in search of other luggage, but he could
see nothing excepting a big basket, which the elderly lady
carried with both hands, holding it in front of her, and
despite her fatigue obstinately determined not to put it down.
From underneath the lid, which was a little raised, there
peeped, amongst some bundles of linen, the end of a comb
wrapped in paper and the neck of a clumsily corked bottle.</p>

<p>'Oh! don't trouble yourself with that,' said Mouret, just
touching the trunk with his foot; 'it can't be very heavy, and
Rose will be able to carry it up by herself.'</p>

<p>He was quite unconscious of the secret contempt which
oozed out from his words. The elderly lady gave him a
keen glance with her black eyes, and then let her gaze
again fall upon the dining-room and the table, which she had
been examining ever since her arrival. She kept her lips
tightly compressed, while her eyes strayed from one object to
another. She had not uttered a single word. Abbé Faujas
consented to leave his trunk where it was. In the yellow rays
of the sunlight which streamed in from the garden, his
threadbare cassock looked quite ruddy; it was darned at the
edges; and, though it was scrupulously clean, it seemed so
sadly thin and wretched that Marthe, who had hitherto
remained seated with a sort of uneasy reserve, now in her turn
rose from her seat. The Abbé, who had merely cast a rapid
glance at her, and had then quickly turned his eyes elsewhere,
saw her leave her chair, although he did not appear to
be watching her.</p>

<p>'I beg you,' he repeated, 'do not disturb yourselves. We
should be extremely distressed to interfere with your dinner.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' said Mouret, who was hungry, 'Rose shall
show you up. Tell her to get you anything you want, and
make yourselves at home.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas bowed and was making his way to the
staircase, when Marthe stepped up to her husband and
whispered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>'But, my dear, you have forgotten&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What? what?' he asked, seeing her hesitate.</p>

<p>'There is the fruit, you know.'</p>

<p>'Oh! bother it all, so there is!' he exclaimed with an
expression of annoyance.</p>

<p>And as Abbé Faujas stepped back and glanced at him
questioningly, he added:</p>

<p>'I am extremely vexed, sir. Father Bourrette is a very
worthy man, but it is a little unfortunate that you commissioned
him to attend to your business. He hasn't got the
least bit of a head. If we had only known of your coming,
we should have had everything ready; but, as it is, we shall
have to clear the whole place out for you. We have been
using the rooms, you see; we have stowed all our crop of
fruit, figs, apples and raisins, away on the floors upstairs.'</p>

<p>The priest listened with a surprise which all his politeness
did not enable him to hide.</p>

<p>'But it won't take us long,' Mouret continued. 'If you
don't mind waiting for ten minutes, Rose will get the rooms
cleared for you.'</p>

<p>An anxious expression appeared on the priest's cadaverous
face.</p>

<p>'The rooms are furnished, are they not?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Not at all; there isn't a bit of furniture in them. We
have never occupied them.'</p>

<p>Thereupon the Abbé lost his self-control, and his grey
eyes flashed as he exclaimed with suppressed indignation:</p>

<p>'But I gave distinct instructions in my letter that furnished
rooms were to be taken. I could scarcely bring my
furniture along with me in my trunk.'</p>

<p>'Well, that just fits in with what I have been saying!'
cried Mouret, in a louder voice. 'The way that Bourrette
goes on is quite incredible. He certainly saw the apples when
he came to look at the rooms, sir, for he took up one of them
and remarked that he had rarely seen such fine fruit. He said
that everything seemed quite suitable, that the rooms were
all that was necessary, and he took them.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas was no longer listening to Mouret; his
cheeks were flushed with anger. He turned round and stammered
in a broken voice:</p>

<p>'Do you hear, mother? There is no furniture.'</p>

<p>The old lady, with her thin black shawl drawn tightly
round her, had just been inspecting the ground-floor, stepping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
furtively hither and thither, but without once putting down
her basket. She had gone to the door of the kitchen and
had scrutinised the four walls there, and then, standing on
the steps that overlooked the terrace, she had taken in all the
garden at one long, searching glance. But it was the dining-room
that seemed more especially to interest her, and she was
now again standing in front of the table laid for dinner,
watching the steam of the soup rise, when her son repeated:</p>

<p>'Do you hear, mother? We shall have to go to the hotel.'</p>

<p>She raised her head without making any reply; but the
expression of her whole face seemed to indicate a settled
determination to remain in that house, with whose every
corner she had already made herself acquainted. She
shrugged her shoulders almost imperceptibly, and again her
wandering eyes strayed from the kitchen to the garden and
then from the garden to the dining-room.</p>

<p>Mouret, however, was growing impatient. As he saw that
neither the mother nor her son seemed to make up their minds
to leave the place, he said:</p>

<p>'We have no beds, unfortunately. True, there is, in the
loft, a folding-bedstead, which perhaps, at a pinch, madame
might make do until to-morrow. But I really don't know
how Monsieur l'Abbé is to manage to sleep.'</p>

<p>Then at last Madame Faujas opened her lips. She spoke
in a curt and somewhat hoarse voice:</p>

<p>'My son will take the folding-bedstead. A mattress on
the floor, in a corner, will be quite sufficient for me.'</p>

<p>The Abbé signified his approval of this arrangement by a
nod. Mouret was going to protest and try to think of some
other plan, but, seeing the satisfied appearance of his new
tenants, he kept silence and merely exchanged a glance of
astonishment with his wife.</p>

<p>'To-morrow it will be light,' he said, with his touch of
<i>bourgeois</i> banter, 'and you will be able to furnish as you like.
Rose will go up and clear away the fruit and make the beds.
Will you wait for a few minutes on the terrace? Come,
children, take a couple of chairs out.'</p>

<p>Since the arrival of the priest and his mother, the young
people had remained quietly seated at the table, curiously
scrutinising the new-comers. The Abbé had not appeared to
notice them, but Madame Faujas had stopped for a moment
before each of them and stared them keenly in the face as
though she were trying to pry into their young heads. As they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
heard their father, they all three hastily rose and took some
chairs out.</p>

<p>The old lady did not sit down; and when Mouret, losing
sight of her, turned round to find out what had become of
her, he saw her standing before a window of the drawing-room
which was ajar. She craned out her neck and completed
her inspection with all the calm deliberation of a
person who is examining some property for sale. Just as
Rose took up the little trunk, however, she went back into the
passage, and said quietly:</p>

<p>'I will go up and help you.'</p>

<p>Then she went upstairs after the servant. The priest did
not even turn his head; he was smiling at the three young
people who still stood in front of him. In spite of the hardness
of his brow and the stern lines about his mouth, his
face was capable of expressing great gentleness, when such
was his desire.</p>

<p>'Is this the whole of your family, madame?' he asked
Marthe, who had just come up to him.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' she replied, feeling a little confused beneath
the clear gaze which he turned upon her.</p>

<p>Looking again at her children, he continued:</p>

<p>'You've got two big lads there, who will soon be men&mdash;Have
you finished your studies yet, my boy?'</p>

<p>It was to Serge that he addressed this question. Mouret
interrupted the lad as he was going to reply.</p>

<p>'Yes, he has finished,' said the father; 'though he is the
younger of the two. When I say that he has finished, I
mean that he has taken his bachelor's degree, for he is staying
on at college for another year to go through a course of
philosophy. He is the clever one of the family. His
brother, the elder, that great booby there, isn't up to much.
He has been plucked twice already, but he still goes on idling
his time away and larking about.'</p>

<p>Octave listened to his father's reproaches with a smile,
while Serge bent his head beneath his praises. Faujas
seemed to be studying them for a moment in silence, and
then, going up to Désirée and putting on an expression of
gentle tenderness, he said to her:</p>

<p>'Will you allow me, mademoiselle, to be your friend?'</p>

<p>She made no reply but, half afraid, hastened to hide her
face against her mother's shoulder. The latter, instead of
making her turn round again, pressed her more closely to
her, clasping an arm around her waist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>'Excuse her,' she said with a touch of sadness, 'she hasn't
a strong head, she has remained quite childish. She is an
"innocent," we do not trouble her by attempting to teach her.
She is fourteen years old now, and as yet she has only learned
to love animals.'</p>

<p>Désirée's confidence returned to her with her mother's
caresses, and she lifted up her head and smiled. Then she
boldly said to the priest:</p>

<p>'I should like you very much to be my friend; but you
must promise me that you will never hurt the flies. Will
you?'</p>

<p>And then, as every one about her began to smile, she
added gravely:</p>

<p>'Octave crushes them, the poor flies! It is very wicked
of him.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas sat down. He seemed very much tired. He
yielded for a moment or two to the cool quietness of the
terrace, glancing slowly over the garden and the neighbouring
trees. The perfect calmness and solitude of this quiet corner
of the little town seemed somewhat to surprise him.</p>

<p>'It is very pleasant here,' he murmured.</p>

<p>Then he relapsed into silence, and seemed lost in reverie.
He started slightly as Mouret said to him with a laugh:</p>

<p>'If you will allow us, sir, we will now go back to our
dinner.'</p>

<p>And then, catching a glance from his wife, Mouret added:</p>

<p>'You must sit down with us and have a plate of soup.
It will save you the trouble of having to go to the hotel to
dine. Don't make any difficulty, I beg.'</p>

<p>'I am extremely obliged to you, but we really don't require
anything,' the Abbé replied in tones of extreme politeness,
which allowed of no repetition of the invitation.</p>

<p>The Mourets then returned to the dining-room and seated
themselves round the table. Marthe served the soup and
there was soon a cheerful clatter of spoons. The young
people chattered merrily, and Désirée broke into a peal of
ringing laughter as she listened to a story which her father,
who was now in high glee at having at last got to his dinner,
was telling. In the meantime, Abbé Faujas, whom they had
quite forgotten, remained motionless upon the terrace, facing
the setting sun. He did not even turn his head, he seemed
to hear nothing of what was going on behind him. Just as
the sun was disappearing he took off his hat as if overcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
by the heat. Marthe, who was sitting with her face to the
window, could see his big bare head with its short hair that
was already silvering about the temples. A last red ray lighting
up that stern soldier-like head, on which the tonsure lay
like a cicatrised wound from the blow of a club; then the
ray faded away and the priest, now wrapped in shadow,
seemed nothing more than a black silhouette against the
ashy grey of the gloaming.</p>

<p>Not wishing to summon Rose, Marthe herself went to get
a lamp and brought in the first dish. As she was returning
from the kitchen, she met, at the foot of the staircase, a
woman whom she did not at first recognise. It was Madame
Faujas. She had put on a cotton cap and looked like a servant
in her common print gown, with a yellow kerchief
crossed over her breast and knotted behind her waist. Her
wrists were bare, she was quite out of breath with the work
she had been doing, and her heavy laced boots clattered on
the flooring of the passage.</p>

<p>'Ah! you've got all put right now, have you, madame?'
Marthe asked with a smile.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes! it was a mere trifle and was done directly,'
Madame Faujas replied.</p>

<p>She went down the steps that led to the terrace, and
called in a gentler tone:</p>

<p>'Ovide, my child, will you come upstairs now? Everything
is quite ready.'</p>

<p>She was obliged to go and lay her hand upon her son's
shoulder to awaken him from his reverie. The air was
growing cool, and the Abbé shivered as he got up and
followed his mother in silence. As he passed before the
door of the dining-room which was all bright with the cheerful
glow of the lamp and merry with the chatter of the young
folks, he peeped in and said in his flexible voice:</p>

<p>'Let me thank you again, and beg you to excuse us for
having so disturbed you. We are very sorry&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No! no!' cried Mouret, 'it is we who are sorry and
distressed at not being able to offer you better accommodation
for the night.'</p>

<p>The priest bowed, and Marthe again met that clear gaze
of his, that eagle glance which had affected her before. In
the depths of his eyes, which were generally of a melancholy
grey, flames seemed to gleam at times like lamps carried
behind the windows of slumbering houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>'The priest's not at all shamefaced,' Mouret remarked
jestingly, when the mother and son had retired.</p>

<p>'I don't think they are very well off,' Marthe replied.</p>

<p>'Well, at any rate, he isn't carrying Peru about with him
in that box of his,' Mouret exclaimed. 'And it's light
enough! Why, I could have raised it with the tip of my
little finger!'</p>

<p>But he was interrupted in his flow of chatter by Rose, who
had just come running down the stairs to relate the extraordinary
things she had witnessed.</p>

<p>'Well, she is a wonderful creature, indeed!' she cried,
posting herself in front of the table at which the family were
eating. 'She's sixty-five at least, but she doesn't show it at
all, and she bustles about, and works like a horse!'</p>

<p>'Did she help you to remove the fruit?' Mouret asked,
with some curiosity.</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed, she did, sir! She carried it away in her
apron, in loads heavy enough to burst it. I kept saying to
myself, "The apron will certainly go this time," but it didn't.
It is made of good strong material, the same kind of material
as I wear myself. We made at least ten journeys backwards
and forwards, and I felt as though my arms would fall off,
but she only grumbled, and complained that we were getting
on very slowly. I really believe, begging your pardon for
mentioning it, that I heard her swear.'</p>

<p>Mouret appeared to be greatly amused.</p>

<p>'And the beds?' he asked.</p>

<p>'The beds, she made them too. It was quite a sight to
see her turn the mattress over. It seemed to weigh nothing,
I can tell you; she just took hold of it at one end and tossed
it into the air as though it had been a feather. And yet she
was very careful and particular with it all. She tucked in
the folding-bed as carefully as though she were preparing a
baby's cradle. She couldn't have laid the sheets with greater
devotion if the Infant Jesus Himself had been going to sleep
there. She put three out of the four blankets upon the
folding-bed. And it was just the same with the pillows; she
kept none for herself, but gave both to her son.'</p>

<p>'She is going to sleep on the floor, then?'</p>

<p>'In a corner, just like a dog! She threw a mattress on
the floor of the other room and said that she'd sleep there
more soundly than if she were in paradise. I couldn't persuade
her to do anything to make herself more comfortable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
She says that she is never cold, and that her head is much too
hard to make her at all afraid of lying on the floor. I have
taken them some sugar and some water, as madame told me.
Oh! they really are the strangest people!'</p>

<p>Then Rose brought in the remainder of the dinner. That
evening the Mourets lingered over their meal. They discussed
the new tenants at great length. In their life, which went on
with all the even regularity of clock-work, the arrival of these
two strangers was a very exciting event. They talked about
it as they would have done of some catastrophe in the neighbourhood,
going into all that minuteness of detail which helps
one to while away long nights in the country. Mouret was
especially fond of the chattering gossip of a little provincial
town. During dessert, as he rested his elbows on the table
in the cool dining-room, he repeated for the tenth time with
the self-satisfied air of a happy man:</p>

<p>'It certainly isn't a very handsome present that Besançon
has made to Plassans! Did you notice the back of his cassock
when he turned round? I shall be very much surprised if he
is much run after by the pious folks here. He is too seedy
and threadbare; and the pious folks like nice-looking
priests.'</p>

<p>'He has a very gentle voice,' said Marthe, indulgently.</p>

<p>'Not when he is angry, at any rate,' Mouret replied.
'Didn't you hear him when he burst out on finding that the
rooms were not furnished? He's a stern man, I'll be bound;
not one of the sort, I should think, to go lounging in confessional-boxes.
I shall be very curious to see how he sets
about his furnishing to-morrow. But as long as he pays me,
I don't much mind anything else. If he doesn't, I shall
apply to Abbé Bourrette. It was with him that I made the
bargain.'</p>

<p>The Mourets were not a devout family. The children
themselves made fun of the Abbé and his mother. Octave
burlesqued the old lady's way of craning out her neck to see
to the end of the rooms, a performance which made Désirée
laugh. After a time, however, Serge, who was of a more
serious turn of mind, stood up for 'those poor people.'</p>

<p>As a rule, precisely at ten o'clock, if he was not playing at
piquet, Mouret took up his candlestick and went off to bed,
but that evening, when eleven o'clock struck, he was not yet
feeling drowsy. Désirée had fallen asleep, with her head
lying on Marthe's knees. The two lads had gone up to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
room; and Mouret, left alone with his wife, still went on
chattering.</p>

<p>'How old do you suppose he is?' he suddenly asked.</p>

<p>'Who?' replied Marthe, who was now beginning to feel
very sleepy.</p>

<p>'Who? Why, the Abbé, of course! Between forty and
forty-five, eh? He's a fine strapping fellow. It's a pity for
him to wear a cassock! He would have made a splendid
carbineer.'</p>

<p>Then, after an interval of silence, he vented aloud the
reflections which were exercising his mind:</p>

<p>'They arrived by the quarter to seven train. They can
only have just had time to call on Abbé Bourrette before
coming here. I'll wager that they haven't dined! That is
quite clear. We should certainly have seen them if they had
gone out to the hotel. Ah, now! I should very much like
to know where they can have had anything to eat.'</p>

<p>Rose had been lingering about the dining-room for the
last few moments, waiting for her master and mistress to go
to bed in order that she might be at liberty to fasten the
doors and windows.</p>

<p>'I know where they had something to eat,' she said. And
as Mouret turned briskly towards her, she added: 'Yes, I had
gone upstairs again to see if there was anything they wanted.
As I heard no sound, I didn't venture to knock at the door,
but I looked through the key-hole.'</p>

<p>'Why, that was very improper of you, very improper,'
Marthe interrupted, severely. 'You know very well, Rose,
that I don't approve of anything of that kind.'</p>

<p>'Leave her alone and let her go on!' cried Mouret, who,
under other circumstances, would have been very angry with
the inquisitive woman. 'You peeped through the key-hole,
did you?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir; I thought it was the best plan.'</p>

<p>'Clearly so. What were they doing?'</p>

<p>'Well, sir, they were eating. I saw them sitting on one
corner of the folding-bedstead and eating. The old lady had
spread out a napkin. Every time that they helped themselves
to some wine, they corked the bottle again and laid it
down against the pillow.'</p>

<p>'But what were they eating?'</p>

<p>'I couldn't quite tell, sir. It seemed to me like the
remains of some pastry wrapped up in a newspaper. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
had some apples as well&mdash;little apples that looked good for
nothing.'</p>

<p>'They were talking, I suppose? Did you hear what they
said?'</p>

<p>'No, sir, they were not talking. I stayed for a good
quarter of an hour watching them, but they never said anything.
They were much too busy eating!'</p>

<p>Marthe now rose, woke Désirée, and made as though she
were going off to bed. Her husband's curiosity vexed her.
He, too, at last made up his mind to go off upstairs, while old
Rose, who was a pious creature, went on in a lower tone:</p>

<p>'The poor, dear man must have been frightfully hungry.
His mother handed him the biggest pieces and watched him
swallow them with delight. And now he'll sleep in some
nice white sheets; unless, indeed, the smell of the fruit keeps
him awake. It isn't a pleasant smell to have in one's bedroom,
that sour odour of apples and pears. And there isn't a bit of
furniture in the whole room, nothing but the bed in the
corner! If I were he, I should feel quite frightened, and I
should keep the light burning all night.'</p>

<p>Mouret had taken up his candlestick. He stood for a
moment in front of Rose, and summed up the events of the
evening like a genuine <i>bourgeois</i> who has met with something
unusual: 'It is extraordinary!'</p>

<p>Then he joined his wife at the foot of the staircase. She
got into bed and fell asleep, while he still continued listening
to the slightest sounds that proceeded from the upper floor.
The Abbé's room was immediately over his own. He heard
the window of it being gently opened, and this greatly excited
his curiosity. He raised his head from his pillow, and
strenuously struggled against his increasing drowsiness in his
anxiety to find out how long the Abbé would remain at the
window. But sleep was too strong for him, and he was
snoring noisily before he had been able to detect the grating
sound which the window-fastening made when it was closed.</p>

<p>Up above, Abbé Faujas was gazing, bare-headed, out of
his window into the black night. He lingered there for a long
time, glad to find himself at last alone, absorbed in those
thoughts which gave his brow such an expression of sternness.
Underneath him, he was conscious of the tranquil slumber of
the family whose home he had been sharing for the last few
hours; the calm, easy breathing of the children and their
mother Marthe, and the heavy, regular respiration of Mouret.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
There was a touch of scorn in the way in which the priest
stretched out his muscular neck, as he raised his head to gaze
upon the town that lay slumbering in the distance. The tall
trees in the garden of the Sub-Prefecture formed a mass of
gloomy darkness, and Monsieur Rastoil's pear-trees thrust up
scraggy, twisted branches, while, further away, there was but
a sea of black shadow, a blank nothingness, whence not a
sound proceeded. The town lay as tranquilly asleep as an
infant in its cradle.</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas stretched out his arms with an air of ironic
defiance, as though he would have liked to circle them round
Plassans, and squeeze the life out of it by crushing it against
his brawny chest. And he murmured to himself:</p>

<p>'Ah! to think that the imbeciles laughed at me this evening,
as they saw me going through their streets!'</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="III" id="III">III</a></h3>


<p>Mouret spent the whole of the next morning in playing the
spy on his new tenant. This espionage would now enable
him to fill up the idle hours which he had hitherto spent in
pottering about the house, in putting back into their proper
places any articles which he happened to find lying about,
and in picking quarrels with his wife and children. Henceforth
he would have an occupation, an amusement which
would relieve the monotony of his everyday life. As he had
often said, he was not partial to priests, and yet Abbé Faujas,
the first one who had entered into his existence, excited in
him an extraordinary amount of interest. This priest brought
with him a touch of mystery and secrecy that was almost
disquieting. Although Mouret was a strong-minded man and
professed himself to be a follower of Voltaire, yet in the
Abbé's presence he felt the astonishment and uneasiness of a
common <i>bourgeois</i>.</p>

<p>Not a sound came from the second floor. Mouret stood
on the staircase and listened eagerly; he even ventured to go
to the loft. As he hushed his steps while passing along the
passage, a pattering of slippers behind the door filled him with
emotion. But he did not succeed in making any new discovery,
so he went down into the garden and strolled into the
arbour at the end of it, there raising his eyes and trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
look through the windows in order to find out what might be
going on in the rooms. But he could not see even the
Abbé's shadow. Madame Faujas, in the absence of curtains,
had, as a makeshift, fastened some sheets behind the
windows.</p>

<p>At lunch Mouret seemed quite vexed.</p>

<p>'Are they dead upstairs?' he said, as he cut the children's
bread. 'Have you heard them move, Marthe?'</p>

<p>'No, my dear; but I haven't been listening.'</p>

<p>Rose thereupon cried out from the kitchen: 'They've
been gone ever so long. They must be far enough away
now if they've kept on at the same pace.'</p>

<p>Mouret summoned the cook and questioned her minutely.</p>

<p>'They went out, sir: first the mother, and then the priest.
They walked so softly that I should never have known anything
about it if their shadows had not fallen across the
kitchen floor when they opened the street door. I looked out
into the street to see where they were going, but they had
vanished. They must have gone off in a fine hurry.'</p>

<p>'It is very surprising. But where was I at the time?'</p>

<p>'I think you were in the garden, sir, looking at the grapes
in the arbour.'</p>

<p>This put Mouret into a very bad temper. He began to
inveigh against priests. They were a set of mystery-mongers,
a parcel of underhand schemers, with whom the devil himself
would be at a loss. They affected such ridiculous prudery
that no one had ever seen a priest wash his face. And
then he wound up by expressing his sorrow that he had
ever let his rooms to this Abbé, about whom he knew nothing
at all.</p>

<p>'It is all your fault!' he exclaimed to his wife, as he got
up from table.</p>

<p>Marthe was about to protest and remind him of their discussion
on the previous day, but she raised her eyes and
simply looked at him, saying nothing. Mouret, contrary to
his usual custom, resolved to remain at home. He pottered
up and down between the dining-room and the garden, poking
about everywhere, pretending that nothing was in its place
and that the house simply invited thieves. Then he got
indignant with Serge and Octave, who had set off for the
college, he said, quite half an hour too soon.</p>

<p>'Isn't father going out?' Désirée whispered in her
mother's ear. 'He will worry us to death if he stays at home.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Marthe hushed her. At last Mouret began to speak of a
piece of business which he declared he must finish off during
the day. And then he complained that he had never a
moment to himself, and could never get a day's rest at
home when he felt he wanted it. Finally he went away,
quite distressed that he could not remain and see what
happened.</p>

<p>When he returned in the evening he was all on fire with
curiosity.</p>

<p>'Well, what about the Abbé?' he asked, without even
giving himself time to take off his hat.</p>

<p>Marthe was working in her usual place on the terrace.</p>

<p>'The Abbé!' she repeated, with an appearance of surprise.
'Oh, yes! the Abbé&mdash;I've really seen nothing of him, but I
believe he has got settled down now. Rose told me that some
furniture had come.'</p>

<p>'That's just what I was afraid of!' exclaimed Mouret. 'I
wanted to be here when it came; for, you see, the furniture
is my security. I knew very well that you would never think
of stirring from your chair. You haven't much of a head,
my dear&mdash;Rose! Rose!'</p>

<p>The cook appeared in answer to his summons, and he
forthwith asked her: 'There's some furniture come for the
people on the second floor?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir; it came in a little covered cart. I recognised it
as Bergasse's; the second-hand dealer's. It wasn't a big load.
Madame Faujas came on behind it. I dare say she had been
giving the man who pushed it along a helping hand up the
Rue Balande.'</p>

<p>'At any rate, you saw the furniture, I suppose? Did you
notice what there was?'</p>

<p>'Certainly, sir. I had posted myself by the door, and it
all went past me, which didn't seem to please Madame Faujas
very much. Wait a moment and I'll tell you everything
there was. First of all they brought up an iron bedstead,
then a chest of drawers, then two tables and four chairs; and
that was the whole lot of it. And it wasn't new either.
I wouldn't have given thirty crowns for the whole collection.'</p>

<p>'But you should have told madame; we cannot let the
rooms under such conditions. I shall go at once to talk to
Abbé Bourrette about the matter.'</p>

<p>He was fuming with irritation, and was just setting off,
when Marthe brought him to a sudden halt by saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh! I had forgotten to tell you. They have paid me
six months' rent in advance.'</p>

<p>'What! They have paid you?' he stammered out, almost
in a tone of annoyance.</p>

<p>'Yes, the old lady came down and gave me this.'</p>

<p>She put her hand into her work-bag, and gave her
husband seventy-five francs in hundred-sou-pieces, neatly
wrapt up in a piece of newspaper. Mouret counted the money,
and muttered:</p>

<p>'As long as they pay, they are free to stop. But they
are strange folks, all the same. Everyone can't be rich, of
course, but that is no reason why one should behave in this
suspicious manner, when one's poor.'</p>

<p>'There is something else I have to tell you,' Marthe continued,
as she saw him calm down. 'The old lady asked me
if we were disposed to part with the folding-bed to her. I
told her that we made no use of it, and that she was welcome
to keep it as long as she liked.'</p>

<p>'You did quite right. We must do what we can to
oblige them. As I told you before, what bothers me about
these confounded priests is that one never can tell what they
are thinking about, or what they are up to. Apart from that,
you will often find very honourable men amongst them.'</p>

<p>The money seemed to have consoled him. He joked and
teased Serge about his book on the Chinese missions, which
the boy happened to be reading just then. During dinner he
affected to feel no further curiosity about the tenants of the
second floor; but, when Octave mentioned that he had seen
Abbé Faujas leaving the Bishop's residence, he could not
restrain himself. Directly the dessert was placed on the
table he resumed his chatter of the previous evening, though
after a time he began to feel a little ashamed of himself.
His commercial pursuits had made him stolid and heavy, but
he really had a keen mind; he was possessed of no little
common sense and accuracy of judgment which often enabled
him to pick out the truth from the midst of all the gossip of
the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>'After all,' he said, as he went off to bed, 'one has no
business to go prying into other people's affairs. The Abbé
is quite at liberty to do as he pleases. It is getting wearisome
to be always talking about these people, and I, for my part,
shall say nothing more about them.'</p>

<p>A week passed away. Mouret had resumed his habitual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
life. He prowled about the house, lectured his children, and
spent his afternoons away from home, amusing himself by
transacting various bits of business, of which he never spoke;
and he ate and slept like a man for whom life is an easy
downhill journey, without any jolts or surprises of any kind.
The whole place sank back into all its old monotony. Marthe
occupied her accustomed seat on the terrace, with her little
work-table in front of her. Désirée played by her side. The
two lads came home at the usual time, and were as noisy
as ever; and Rose, the cook, grumbled and growled at
everyone; while the garden and the dining-room retained all
their wonted sleepy calm.</p>

<p>'You see now,' Mouret often repeated to his wife, 'you
were quite mistaken in thinking that our comfort would be
interfered with, by our letting the second-floor. We are as
quiet and happy as ever we were, and the house seems smaller
and cosier.'</p>

<p>He occasionally raised his eyes towards the second-floor
windows, which Madame Faujas had hung with thick cotton
curtains, on the day after her arrival. These curtains were
never drawn aside. There was a conventual look about their
stern, cold folds, and they seemed to tell of deep, unbroken
silence, cloistral stillness lurking behind them. At distant
intervals the windows were set ajar, and allowed the high,
shadowy ceilings to be seen between the snowy whiteness of
the curtains. But it was all to no purpose that Mouret kept
on the watch, he could never catch sight of the hand which
opened or closed them, and he never even heard the grating
of the window fastening. Never did a sound of human life
come down from the second floor.</p>

<p>The first week was at an end and Mouret had not yet had
another glimpse of Abbé Faujas. That man who was living
in his house, without he ever being able to catch sight even
of his shadow, began to affect him with a kind of nervous
uneasiness. In spite of all the efforts he made to appear
indifferent, he relapsed into his old questionings, and started
an inquiry.</p>

<p>'Have you seen anything of him?' he asked his wife.</p>

<p>'I fancy I caught a glimpse of him yesterday, as he was
coming in, but I am not sure. His mother always wears a
black dress, and it might have been she that I saw.'</p>

<p>And as he continued to press her with questions, Marthe
told him all she knew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>'Rose says that he goes out every day, and stays away a
long time. As for his mother, she is as regular as a clock.
She comes down at seven o'clock in the morning to go out and
do her marketing. She has a big basket, which is always
closed, and in which she must bring everything back with
her, coal, bread, wine and provisions, for no tradesman ever
calls with anything for them. They are very courteous and
polite; and Rose says that they always bow to her when
they meet her. But as a rule she does not even hear them
come down the stairs.'</p>

<p>'They must go in for a funny sort of cooking up there,'
said Mouret, to whom all these details conveyed none of the
information he wanted.</p>

<p>On another evening, when Octave mentioned that he had
seen Abbé Faujas entering Saint-Saturnin's, his father asked
him about the priest's appearance, what effect he had made
upon the passers-by, and what he could be going to do in the
church.</p>

<p>'Ah! you are really much too curious!' cried the young
man, with a laugh. 'He didn't look very fine in the sunshine
with his rusty cassock, I can vouch for that much. I noticed,
too, that, as he walked along, he kept in the shadow of the
houses, which made his cassock look a little blacker. He
didn't seem at all proud of himself, but hurried along with his
head bent down. Two girls began to laugh as he crossed
the Place. The Abbé raised his head and looked at them
with an expression of great softness&mdash;didn't he, Serge?'</p>

<p>Thereupon Serge related how on several occasions, as he
was returning from the college, he had at a distance followed
the Abbé, who was on his way back from Saint-Saturnin's.
He passed through the streets without speaking to anyone;
he seemed to know nobody and to be rather hurt by the suppressed
titters and jeers which he heard around him.</p>

<p>'Do they talk of him, then, in the town?' asked Mouret,
whose interest was greatly aroused.</p>

<p>'No one has ever spoken to me about him,' Octave replied.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Serge,' they do talk of him. Abbé Bourrette's
nephew told me that he wasn't a favourite at the church.
They are not fond of these priests who come from a distance;
and besides he has such a miserable appearance. When
people get accustomed to him, they will leave the poor man
alone, but just at first it is only natural that he should attract
notice.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Marthe thereupon advised the two young fellows not to
gratify any outsider's curiosity about the Abbé.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes! they may answer any questions,' Mouret exclaimed.
'Certainly nothing that we know of him could be
likely to compromise him in any way.'</p>

<p>From that time forward, with the best faith in the world
and without meaning the least harm, Mouret turned his
sons into a couple of spies. He told Octave and Serge that
they must repeat to him all that was said about the priest in
the town, and he even instructed them to follow him whenever
they came across him. But the information that was
to be derived from such sources was quickly exhausted. The
talk occasioned by the arrival of a strange curate in the
diocese died away; the town seemed to have extended
its pardon to the 'poor fellow,' who glided about in the
shade in such a rusty old cassock, and its only apparent
feeling for him now was one of disdain. The priest, on the
other hand, always went straight to the cathedral and so
returned from it, invariably passing through the same streets.
Octave said, laughingly, that he was sure he counted the
paving-stones.</p>

<p>Then Mouret bethought himself of enlisting the help of
Désirée in the task of collecting information. In the evening
he took her to the bottom of the garden and listened to her
chatter about what she had done and what she had seen
during the day, and he always tried to lead her on to the subject
of the tenants of the second floor.</p>

<p>'Now, just listen to what I tell you,' he said to her one
day. 'To-morrow, when the window is open, just throw your
ball into the room, and then go up and ask for it.'</p>

<p>The next day the girl threw her ball into the room, but
she had scarcely reached the steps of the house before the ball,
returned by an invisible hand, bounced up from the terrace.
Her father, who had reckoned on the child's taking ways
leading to a renewal of the intercourse which had been interrupted
since the day of the priest's arrival, now lost all hope.
It was quite clear that the Abbé had made up his mind to
keep to himself. This rebuff, however, only made Mouret's
curiosity all the keener. He even condescended to go gossiping
in corners with the cook, to the great displeasure of
Marthe, who reproached him for his want of self-respect; but
at this he became angry with her and defended himself by
lies. However, as he felt that he was in the wrong, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
only in secret that he henceforth talked to Rose about the
Faujases.</p>

<p>One morning she beckoned to him to follow her into the
kitchen.</p>

<p>'Oh, sir!' she said, as she shut the door, 'I have been
watching for you to come down from your room for more
than an hour.'</p>

<p>'Have you found out something then?'</p>

<p>'Well, you shall hear. Yesterday evening I was chatting
with Madame Faujas for more than an hour!'</p>

<p>Mouret felt a thrill of joy. He sat down on an old tattered
rush-bottom chair, in the midst of the dirty cloths and vegetable
parings left from the previous day, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Go along! make haste!'</p>

<p>'Well,' continued the cook, 'I was at the street-door saying
good-night to Monsieur Rastoil's servant, when Madame
Faujas came downstairs to empty a pail of dirty water in the
gutter. Instead of immediately going back again, without
even turning her head, as she generally does, she stopped
there for a moment to look at me. Then it struck me that
she wanted to speak to me, and I said to her that it had been
a beautiful day, and that it would be good for the grapes.
She said, "Yes, yes," in an unconcerned sort of way, just like
a woman who has no land and has no interest in such matters.
But she put down her pail and made no attempt to go away;
she even came and leant against the wall beside me&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Well! well! what did she say to you?' cried Mouret,
tortured by his impatience.</p>

<p>'Well, of course, you understand I wasn't silly enough to
begin to question her. She would have gone straight off if I
had. Without seeming to intend anything, I suggested things
to her which I thought might set her talking. The Curé<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of
Saint-Saturnin's, that worthy Monsieur Compan, happened
to pass by, and I told her he was very ill and wasn't long for
this world, and that there would be great difficulty in filling
his place at the cathedral. She was all ears at once, I can
tell you. She even asked me what was the matter with Monsieur
Compan. Then, going on from one thing to another, I
gradually got talking about our bishop. Monseigneur Rousselot
was a most excellent and worthy man, I told her. She
did not know his age, so I told her that he was sixty, very
delicate also, and that he let himself be led by the nose. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
is a good deal of talk about the vicar-general, Monsieur Fenil,
who is all powerful with the bishop. The old lady was quite
interested in that, and she would have stayed out in the street
all night, listening.'</p>

<p>An expression of desperation passed over Mouret's face.
'But what you're telling me is what you said yourself,' he
cried. 'What was it that she said? That's what I want to
hear.'</p>

<p>'Wait a little and let me finish,' Rose replied very calmly.
'I was gradually gaining my purpose. To win her confidence,
I ended by talking to her about ourselves. I told her that
you were Monsieur François Mouret, a retired merchant from
Marseilles, and that you had managed in fifteen years to
make a fortune out of wines and oils and almonds. I added
that you had preferred to come and settle down and live on
your means in Plassans, a quiet town, where your wife's
relations lived. I even contrived to let her know, too, that
madame was your cousin, that you were forty years old and
that she was thirty-seven, and that you lived very happily
together; in fact, I told her all about you. She seemed to
be very much interested, and kept saying, "Yes, yes," in her
deliberate way; and, when I stopped for a moment, she
nodded her head as though to tell me she was listening and
that I might go on. So we went on talking in this way, with
our backs against the wall, like a couple of old friends, till it
was quite dark.'</p>

<p>Mouret bounced from his chair in angry indignation.</p>

<p>'What!' he cried, 'is that all? She led you on to gossip
to her for an hour, and she herself told you nothing!'</p>

<p>'When it got dark, she said to me: "The air is becoming
quite chilly." And then she took up her pail and went back
upstairs.'</p>

<p>'You are nothing but an idiot! That old woman up
there is more than a match for half a score such as you.
Ah! they'll be laughing finely now that they have wormed
out of you all that they wanted to know about us. Do you
hear me, Rose? I tell you that you are nothing but an
idiot!'</p>

<p>The old cook waxed very indignant, and began to bounce
excitedly up and down the kitchen, knocking the pots and
pans about noisily, and crumpling up the dusters and flinging
them down.</p>

<p>'It was scarcely worth your while, sir,' she hissed, 'to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
come into my kitchen to call me insulting names. You had
better take yourself off. What I did, I did to please you. If
madame finds us here together talking about those people,
she will be angry with me, and quite rightly, because it is
wrong for us to be doing so. And after all, I couldn't drag
words from the old lady's lips if she wasn't willing to talk. I
did as any one else would have done under the same circumstances.
I talked and told her about your affairs, and it was
no fault of mine that she didn't tell me about hers. Go and
ask her about them yourself, since you are anxious to know
about them. Perhaps you won't make such an idiot of yourself
as I have done.'</p>

<p>She had raised her voice, and was talking so loudly that
Mouret thought it would be more prudent to retire, and he
did so, closing the kitchen door after him, in order to prevent
his wife from hearing the servant. But Rose immediately
pulled it open again, and cried after him down the passage:</p>

<p>'I shall bother myself about it no longer; do you hear?
You may get somebody else to do your underhand business
for you!'</p>

<p>Mouret was quite vanquished. He showed some irritation
at his defeat, and tried to console himself by saying that
those second-floor tenants of his were mere nobodies.
Gradually he succeeded in making this opinion of his that of
his acquaintances, and then that of the whole town. Abbé
Faujas came to be looked upon as a priest without means and
without ambition, who was completely outside the pale of
the intrigues of the diocese. People imagined that he was
ashamed of his poverty, that he was glad to perform any
unpleasant duties in connection with the cathedral, and
tried to keep himself in obscurity as much as possible. There
was only one matter of curiosity left in connection with him,
and that was the reason of his having come to Plassans from
Besançon. Queer stories were circulated about him, but they
all seemed very improbable. Mouret himself, who had played
the spy over his tenants simply for amusement and in order
to pass the time, just as he would have played a game at
cards or bowls, was even beginning to forget that he had a
priest living in his house, when an incident occurred which
revived all his curiosity.</p>

<p>One afternoon as he was returning home, he saw Abbé
Faujas going up the Rue Balande in front of him. Mouret
slackened his pace and examined the priest at his leisure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Although Abbé Faujas had been lodging in his house for a
month, this was the first time that he had thus seen him in
broad daylight. The Abbé still wore his old cassock, and he
walked slowly, with his hat in his hand and his head bare in
spite of the chilly air. The street, which was a very steep one,
with the shutters of its big, bare houses always closed, was
quite deserted. Mouret, who quickened his pace, was at last
obliged to walk on tip-toes for fear lest the priest should
hear him and make his escape. But as they neared Monsieur
Rastoil's house, a group of people turning out of the Place
of the Sub-Prefecture entered it. Abbé Faujas made a
slight détour to avoid these persons. He watched the door
close, and then, suddenly stopping, he turned round towards
his landlord, who was now close up to him.</p>

<p>'I am very glad to have met you,' said he, with all his
wonted politeness, 'otherwise I should have ventured to
disturb you this evening. The last time it rained, the wet
came through the ceiling of my room, and I should much
like to show it you.'</p>

<p>Mouret remained standing in front of him, and stammered
in confusion that he was entirely at the Abbé's service. Then,
as they went indoors together, he asked him at what time he
should go to look at the ceiling.</p>

<p>'Well, I should like you to come at once,' the Abbé
replied, 'if it wouldn't be troubling you too much.'</p>

<p>Mouret went up the stairs after him so excited that he
almost choked, while Rose followed them with her eyes from
the kitchen doorway quite dazed with astonishment.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="IV" id="IV">IV</a></h3>


<p>When Mouret reached the second floor he was more perturbed
than a youth at his first assignation. The unexpected satisfaction
of his long thwarted desires, and the hope of seeing
something quite extraordinary, almost prevented him from
breathing. Abbé Faujas slipped the key which he carried,
and which he quite concealed in his big fingers, into the lock
without making the faintest noise, and the door opened as
silently as if it had been hung upon velvet hinges. Then
the Abbé, stepping back, mutely motioned to Mouret to
enter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>The cotton curtains at the two windows were so thick that
the room lay in a pale, chalky dimness like the half-light of a
convent cell. It was a very large room, with a lofty ceiling,
and a quiet, neat wall-paper of a faded yellow. Mouret ventured
forward, advancing with short steps over the tiled floor,
which was as smooth and shiny as a mirror, and so cold that
he seemed to feel a chill through the soles of his boots. He
glanced furtively around him and examined the curtainless
iron bedstead, the sheets of which were so straightly stretched
that it looked like a block of white stone lying in the corner.
The chest of drawers, stowed away at the other end of the
room, a little table in the middle, and two chairs, one before
each window, completed the furniture. There was not a
single paper on the table, not an article of any kind on the
chest of drawers, not a garment hanging against the walls.
Everything was perfectly bare except that over the chest of
drawers there was suspended a big black wooden crucifix, looking
like a dark splotch amidst the bare greyness of the room.</p>

<p>'Come this way, sir, will you?' said the Abbé. 'It is in
this corner that the ceiling is stained.'</p>

<p>But Mouret did not hurry, he was enjoying himself.
Although he saw none of the extraordinary things that he
had vaguely expected to see, there seemed to him to be a
peculiar odour about the room. It smelt of a priest, he
thought; of a man with different ways from other men.
But it vexed him that he could see nothing on which
he might base some hypothesis carelessly left on any
of the pieces of furniture or in any corner of the apartment.
The room was just like its provoking occupant, silent, cold,
and inscrutable. He was extremely surprised, too, not to
find any appearance of poverty as he had expected. On
the contrary, the room produced upon him much the same
impression as he had felt when he had once entered the richly
furnished drawing-room of the prefect of Marseilles. The
big crucifix seemed to fill it with its black arms.</p>

<p>Mouret felt, however, that he must go and look at the
corner which Abbé Faujas was inviting him to inspect.</p>

<p>'You see the stain, don't you?' asked the priest. 'It has
faded a little since yesterday.'</p>

<p>Mouret rose upon tip-toes and strained his eyes, but at
first he could see nothing. When the Abbé had drawn back
the curtains, he was able to distinguish a slight damp-stain.</p>

<p>'It's nothing very serious,' he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh, no! but I thought it would be better to tell you of
it. The wet must have soaked through near the edge of the
roof.'</p>

<p>'Yes, you are right; near the edge of the roof.'</p>

<p>Mouret made no further remark; he was again examining
the room, now clear and distinct in the full daylight. It
looked less solemn than before, but it remained as taciturn as
ever. There was not even a speck of dust lying about to tell
aught of the Abbé's life.</p>

<p>'Perhaps,' continued the priest, 'we may be able to discover
the place from the window. Just wait a moment.'</p>

<p>He proceeded to open the window, but Mouret protested
against him troubling himself any further, saying that the
workmen would easily be able to find the leak.</p>

<p>'It is no trouble at all, I assure you,' replied the Abbé
with polite insistence. 'I know that landlords like to know
how matters are going on. Inspect everything, I beg of you.
The house is yours.'</p>

<p>As he spoke these last words he smiled, a thing he did
but rarely; and then as Mouret and himself leaned over the
rail that crossed the window, and turned their eyes towards
the guttering, he launched out into various technical details,
trying to account for the appearance of the stain.</p>

<p>'I think there has been a slight depression of the tiles,
perhaps even a breakage; unless, indeed, that crack which
you can see up there in the cornice extends into the retaining-wall.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, that is very possible,' Mouret replied; 'but I
must confess, Monsieur l'Abbé, that I really don't understand
anything about these matters. However, the masons will see
to it.'</p>

<p>The priest said nothing further on the subject, but quietly
remained where he was, gazing out upon the garden beneath
him. Mouret, who was leaning by his side, thought it would
be impolite to hurry away. He was quite won over when his
tenant, after an interval of silence, said to him in his soft
voice:</p>

<p>'You have a very pretty garden, sir.'</p>

<p>'Oh! it's nothing out of the common,' replied Mouret.
'There used to be some fine trees which I was obliged to cut
down, for nothing would grow in their shade, and we have to
pay attention to utility, you know. This plot is quite large
enough for us and keeps us in vegetables all through the
season.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>The Abbé seemed surprised, and asked Mouret for details.
The garden was an old-fashioned country garden, surrounded
with arbours, and divided into four regular square plots by
tall borders of box. In the middle was a shallow basin, but
there was no fountain. Only one of the squares was devoted
to flowers. In the other three, which were planted at their
edges with fruit-trees, one saw some magnificent cabbages,
lettuces, and other vegetables. The paths of yellow gravel
were kept extremely neat.</p>

<p>'It is a little paradise,' said Abbé Faujas.</p>

<p>'There are several disadvantages, all the same,' replied
Mouret, who felt extremely delighted at hearing his ground
so highly praised. 'You will have noticed, for instance, that
we are on a slope, and that the gardens hereabouts are on
different levels. Monsieur Rastoil's is lower than mine,
which, again, is lower than that of the Sub-Prefecture. The
consequence is that the rain often does a great deal of damage.
Then, too, a still greater disadvantage is that the people in
the Sub-Prefecture overlook me, and the more so now that
they have made that terrace which commands my wall. It
is true that I overlook Monsieur Rastoil's garden, but that is
very poor compensation I can assure you, for a man who
never troubles himself about his neighbour's doings.'</p>

<p>The priest seemed to be listening out of mere complaisance,
just nodding his head occasionally but making no
remarks. He followed with his eyes the motions of his
landlord's hand.</p>

<p>'And there is still another inconvenience,' continued
Mouret, pointing to a path that skirted the bottom of the
garden. 'You see that little lane between the two walls?
It is called the Impasse des Chevillottes, and leads to a cart-entrance
to the grounds of the Sub-Prefecture. Well, all the
neighbouring properties have little doors giving access to
the lane, and there are all sorts of mysterious comings and
goings. For my part, being a family man with children, I
fastened my door up with a couple of stout nails.'</p>

<p>He looked at the Abbé and winked, hoping that the priest
would question him about the mysterious comings and goings
to which he had just alluded. But Abbé Faujas seemed quite
unconcerned; he merely glanced at the alley without showing
any curiosity on the subject. Then he again gazed placidly
upon the Mourets' garden. Marthe was in her customary
place near the edge of the terrace, hemming napkins. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
had raised her head on first hearing voices, and then had
resumed her work again, full of surprise at seeing her husband
at one of the second-floor windows in the company of the
priest. She now appeared to be quite unconscious of their
presence. Mouret, however, had raised his voice from a sort of
instinctive braggartism, proud of being able to show his wife
that he had at last made his way into that room which had
so persistently been kept private. The Abbé, on his side,
every now and then let his calm eyes rest upon the woman,
though all that he could see of her was the back of her bent
neck and her black coil of hair.</p>

<p>They were both silent again, and Abbé Faujas still seemed
disinclined to leave the window. He now appeared to be examining
their neighbour's flower beds. Monsieur Rastoil's
garden was arranged in the English fashion, with little walks
and grass plots broken by small flower-beds. At the bottom
there was a circular cluster of trees, underneath which a table
and some rustic chairs were set.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Rastoil is very wealthy,' resumed Mouret, who
had followed the direction of the Abbé's eyes. 'His garden
costs him a large sum of money. The waterfall&mdash;you can't
see it from here, it is behind those trees&mdash;ran away with more
than three hundred francs. There isn't a vegetable about
the place, nothing but flowers. At one time the ladies even
talked of cutting down the fruit-trees; but that would have
really been wicked, for the pear-trees are magnificent specimens.
Well, I suppose a man has a right to lay out his
ground so as to please his own fancy, if he can afford to
do so.'</p>

<p>Then, as the Abbé still continued silent, he continued:
'You know Monsieur Rastoil, don't you? Every morning,
from eight o'clock till nine, he walks about under his
trees. He is a heavy man, rather short, bald, and clean
shaven, with a head as round as a ball. He completed his
sixtieth year at the beginning of last August, I believe. He
has been president of our civil tribunal for nearly twenty
years. Folks say he is a very good fellow, but I see very
little of him. "Good-morning," and "Good-evening," that's
about all that ever passes between us.'</p>

<p>He stopped speaking as he saw several people coming
down the steps of the neighbouring house and making their
way towards the clump of trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>'Ah, yes!' he resumed, lowering his voice, 'to-day's
Tuesday. There is a dinner party at the Rastoils'.</p>

<p>The Abbé had not been able to restrain a slight start, and
had then bent forward to see better. Two priests who were
walking beside a couple of tall girls seemed particularly to
interest him.</p>

<p>'Do you know who those gentlemen are?' Mouret
inquired.</p>

<p>And, when the priest only replied by a vague gesture, he
added:</p>

<p>'They were crossing the Rue Balande just as we met each
other. The taller and younger one, the one who is walking
between Monsieur Rastoil's two daughters, is Abbé Surin, our
bishop's secretary. He is said to be a very amiable young
man. The old one, who is walking a little behind, is one of
our grand-vicars, Abbé Fenil. He is at the head of the
seminary. He is a terrible man, flat and sharp, like a sabre.
I wish he would turn round so that you might see his eyes.
I am quite surprised that you don't know those gentlemen.'</p>

<p>'I go out very little,' said the Abbé, 'and there is no
house in the town that I visit.'</p>

<p>'Ah! that isn't right. You must often feel very dull.
To do you justice, Monsieur l'Abbé, you are certainly not of
an inquisitive disposition. Just fancy! you've been here a
month now, and you didn't even know that Monsieur Rastoil
had a dinner-party every Tuesday! Why, it's right before
your eyes there from this window!'</p>

<p>Mouret laughed slightly. He was forming a rather contemptuous
opinion of the Abbé. Then in confidential tones
he went on:</p>

<p>'You see that tall old man who is with Madame Rastoil&mdash;the
thin one I mean, with broad brims to his hat? Well,
that is Monsieur de Bourdeu, the former prefect of the Drôme,
a prefect who was turned out of office by the revolution of
1848. He's another one that you don't know, I'll be bound.
But Monsieur Maffre there, the justice of the peace, that
white-headed old gentleman who is coming last, with Monsieur
Rastoil, don't you know him? Well, that is really inexcusable.
He is an honorary canon of Saint-Saturnin's!
Between ourselves, he is accused of having killed his wife by
his harshness and miserliness.'</p>

<p>Mouret stopped short, looked the Abbé in the face and said
abruptly, with a smile:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>'I beg your pardon, but I am not a very devout person,
you know.'</p>

<p>The Abbé again waved his hand with that vague gesture
which did duty as an answer and saved him the necessity of
making a more explicit reply.</p>

<p>'No, I am not a very devout person,' Mouret repeated
smilingly. 'But everyone should be left free, is it not so?
The Rastoils, now, are a religious family. You must have
seen the mother and daughters at Saint-Saturnin's. They
are parishioners of yours. Ah! those poor girls! The
elder, Angéline, is fully twenty-six years old, and the other,
Aurélie, is getting on for twenty-four. And they're no
beauties either, quite yellow and shrewish-looking. The
parents won't let the younger one marry before her sister;
but I dare say they'll both end by finding husbands somewhere,
if only for the sake of their dowries. Their mother
there, that fat little woman who looks as innocent and mild
as a sheep, has given poor Rastoil some pretty experiences.'</p>

<p>He winked his left eye, a common habit of his whenever
he indulged in any pleasantry approaching broadness. The
Abbé lowered his eyes, as if waiting for Mouret to go on, but,
as the latter remained silent, he raised them again and
watched the people in the garden as they seated themselves
round the table under the trees.</p>

<p>At last Mouret resumed his explanatory remarks.</p>

<p>'They will stay out there, enjoying the fresh air, till
dinner-time,' said he. 'It is just the same every Tuesday.
That Abbé Surin is a great favourite. Look how he is
laughing there with Mademoiselle Aurélie. Ah! Abbé Fenil
has observed us. What eyes he has! He isn't very fond of
me, you know, as I've had a dispute with a relation of his.
But where has Abbé Bourrette got to? We haven't seen
anything of him, have we? It is very extraordinary. He
never misses Monsieur Rastoil's Tuesdays. He must be ill.
You know him, don't you? What a worthy man he is! A
most devoted servant of God!'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas was no longer listening. His eyes were
constantly meeting those of Abbé Fenil, whose scrutiny he
bore with perfect calmness, never once diverting his glance.
He was even leaning more fully against the iron rail, and his
eyes seemed to have grown bigger.</p>

<p>'Ah! here come the young people!' resumed Mouret as
three young men arrived on the scene. 'The oldest one is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Rastoil's son; he has just been called to the Bar. The two
others are the sons of Monsieur Maffre; they are still at
college. By-the-by, I wonder why those young scamps of
mine haven't come back yet.'</p>

<p>At that very moment Octave and Serge made their appearance
on the terrace. Leaning against the balustrade they
began to tease Désirée, who had just sat down by her mother's
side. However, when the young folks caught sight of their
father at the second-floor window, they lowered their voices
and quietly laughed.</p>

<p>'There you see all my little family!' said Mouret complacently.
'We stay at home, we do; and we have no visitors.
Our garden is a closed paradise, which the devil can't enter
to tempt us.'</p>

<p>He smiled as he spoke, for he was really amusing himself
at the Abbé's expense. The latter had slowly brought his
eyes to bear upon the group formed by his landlord's family
under the window. He gazed down there for a moment;
then looked round upon the old-fashioned garden with its
beds of vegetables edged with borders of box; then again
turned his eyes towards Monsieur Rastoil's pretentious
grounds; and last of all, as though he wanted to get the plan
of the whole surroundings into his head, directed his attention
to the garden of the Sub-Prefecture. There was nothing
to be seen here but a large central lawn, a gently undulating
carpet of grass, with clusters of evergreen shrubs, and some
tall thickly-foliaged chestnut trees which gave a park-like
appearance to this patch of ground hemmed in by the neighbouring
houses.</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas glanced under the chestnut-trees, and at last
remarked:</p>

<p>'These gardens are quite lively. There are some people,
too, in the one on the left.'
Mouret raised his eyes.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes!' he said unconcernedly, 'it's like that every
afternoon. They are the friends of Monsieur Péqueur des
Saulaies, our sub-prefect. In the summer-time they meet in
the evenings in the same way round the basin on the left,
which you can't see from here. Ah! so Monsieur de Condamin
has got back! That fine old man there, who is so
well preserved and has such a bright colour; he is our conservator
of rivers and forests; a jovial old fellow, who is
constantly to be seen, gloved and tightly breeched, on horseback.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
And the tales he can tell, too! He doesn't belong
to this neighbourhood, and he has lately married a very
young woman. However, that's fortunately no business of
mine!'</p>

<p>He bent his head again as he heard Désirée, who was
playing with Serge, break out into one of her childish laughs.
But the Abbé, whose face was now slightly flushed, recalled
his attention by asking:</p>

<p>'Is that the sub-prefect, that fat gentleman with the
white tie?'</p>

<p>This question seemed to amuse Mouret exceedingly.</p>

<p>'Oh, no!' he replied, with a laugh. 'It is very evident
that you don't know Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies. He
isn't forty yet; he's a tall, handsome, very distinguished-looking
young man. That fat gentleman is Doctor Porquier,
the fashionable medical man of Plassans. He is a very well-to-do
man, I can assure you, and he has only one trouble, his
son Guillaume. Do you see those two people sitting on the
bench with their backs towards us? They are Monsieur
Paloque, the assistant judge, and his wife. They are the
ugliest couple in the town. It is difficult to say which is the
worse-looking, the husband or the wife. Fortunately they
have no children.'</p>

<p>Mouret began to laugh more loudly; he was growing
excited, and kept on striking the window-rail.</p>

<p>'I can never look at the assemblies in those grounds,' he
continued, motioning with his head, first towards Monsieur
Rastoil's garden and then towards the sub-prefect's, 'without
being highly amused. You don't take any interest in politics,
Monsieur l'Abbé, or I could tell you some things which would
tickle you immensely. Rightly or wrongly, I myself pass for
a republican. Business matters take me a good deal about
the country; I am a friend of the peasantry, and people have
even talked about proposing me for the Council-General&mdash;in
short, I am a well-known man. Well, on my right here, at
Monsieur Rastoil's, we have the cream of the Legitimists, and
on the left, at the Sub-Prefecture, we have the big-wigs of
the Empire. And so, you see, my poor old-fashioned garden,
my little happy nook, lies between two hostile camps. I am
continually afraid lest they should begin throwing stones at
each other, for the stones, you see, might very well fall into
my garden.'</p>

<p>Mouret appeared to be quite delighted with this witticism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and drew closer to the Abbé, like some old gossip who is just
going to launch out into a long story.</p>

<p>'Plassans is a very curious place from a political point of
view. The Coup d'État succeeded here because the town is
conservative. But first of all it is Legitimist and Orleanist;
so much so, indeed, that at the outset of the Empire it
wanted to dictate conditions. As its claims were disregarded,
the town grew annoyed and went over to the opposition; yes,
Monsieur l'Abbé, to the opposition. Last year we elected for
our deputy the Marquis de Lagrifoul, an old nobleman of
mediocre abilities, but one whose election was a very bitter
pill for the Sub-Prefecture.&mdash;Ah, look! there is Monsieur
Péqueur des Saulaies! He is with the mayor, Monsieur
Delangre.'</p>

<p>The Abbé glanced keenly in the direction indicated by
Mouret. The sub-prefect, a very dark man, was smiling
beneath his waxed moustaches. He was irreproachably
dressed, and preserved a demeanour which suggested both
that of a fashionable officer and that of a good-natured
diplomatist. The mayor was by his side, talking and gesticulating
rapidly. He was a short man, with square shoulders,
and a sunken face that was rather Punch-like in appearance.
He seemed to be garrulously inclined.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies,' continued Mouret, 'had
felt so confident of the return of the official candidate that the
result of the election nearly made him ill. It was very
amusing. On the evening of the election, the garden of the
Sub-Prefecture remained as dark and gloomy as a cemetery,
while in the Rastoils' grounds there were lamps and candles
burning under the trees, and joyous laughter and a perfect
uproar of triumph. Our people don't let things be seen from
the street, but they throw off all restraint and give full vent
to their feelings in their gardens. Oh, yes! I see singular
things sometimes, though I don't say anything about them.'</p>

<p>He checked himself for a moment, as though he was
unwilling to say more, but his gossiping propensities were too
strong for him.</p>

<p>'I wonder what course they will now take at the Sub-Prefecture?'
he continued. 'They will never get their
candidate elected again. They don't understand the people
about here, and besides they are very weak. I was told that
Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies was to have had a prefecture
if the election had gone off all right. Ah! he will remain a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
sub-prefect for a long time yet, I imagine! What stratagem
will they devise, I wonder, to overthrow the Marquis? They
will certainly have recourse to one of some kind or other; they
will do their best somehow to effect the conquest of Plassans.'</p>

<p>He turned his eyes upon the Abbé, at whom he had
ceased to look for the last few moments, and he suddenly
checked himself as he caught sight of the priest's eager face,
his glistening eyes, and his ears that seemed to have grown
bigger. All Mouret's <i>bourgeois</i> prudence then reasserted
itself, and he felt that he had said too much. So he hastily
added:</p>

<p>'But, after all, I really know nothing about it. People
tell so many ridiculous stories. All I care about is to be
allowed to live quietly in my own house.'</p>

<p>He would then have liked to leave the window, but he
dared not go away so suddenly after gossiping in such an
unrestrained and familiar fashion. He was beginning to
think that if one of them had been having his laugh at the
other, it certainly was not he.</p>

<p>The Abbé, for his part, was again glancing alternately
at the two gardens in a calm, unconcerned manner, and did
not make the slightest attempt to induce Mouret to continue
talking. Mouret was already wishing, somewhat impatiently,
that his wife or one of his children would call to him to come
down, when he was greatly relieved by seeing Rose appear on
the steps outside the house. She raised her head towards him.</p>

<p>'Well, sir!' she cried, 'aren't you coming at all to-day?
The soup has been on the table for the last quarter of an hour!'</p>

<p>'All right, Rose! I'll be down directly,' he replied.</p>

<p>Then he made his apologies to the Abbé, and left the window.
The chilly aspect of the room, which he had forgotten
while his back had been turned to it, added to the confusion
he felt. It seemed to him like a huge confessional-box, with
its awful black crucifix, which must have heard everything he
had said. When the Abbé took leave of him with a silent
bow, this sudden finish of their conversation so disturbed
him, that he again stepped back and, raising his eyes to the
ceiling, said:</p>

<p>'It is in that corner, then?'</p>

<p>'What is?' asked the Abbé in surprise.</p>

<p>'The damp stain that you spoke to me about.'</p>

<p>The priest could not restrain a smile, but he again
pointed out the stain to Mouret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>'Ah! I can see it quite plainly now,' said the latter.
'Well, I'll send the workmen up to-morrow.'</p>

<p>Then he at last left the room, and before he had reached
the end of the landing, the door was noiselessly closed behind
him. The silence of the staircase irritated him extremely, and
as he went down, he muttered:</p>

<p>'The confounded fellow! He gets everything out of one
without asking a single question!'</p>




<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="V" id="V">V</a></h3>


<p>The next morning old Madame Rougon, Marthe's mother,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
came to pay a visit to the Mourets. It was quite an event,
for there was a coolness between Mouret and his wife's relations
which had increased since the election of the Marquis
de Lagrifoul, whose success the Rougons attributed to Mouret's
influence in the rural districts. Marthe used to go alone
when she went to see her parents. Her mother, 'that black
Félicité,' as she was called, had retained at sixty-six years of
age all the slimness and vivacity of a girl. She always wore
silk dresses, covered with flounces, and was particularly partial
to yellows and browns.</p>

<p>When she arrived, only Marthe and Mouret were in the
dining-room.</p>

<p>'Hallo!' cried the latter in great surprise, as he saw her
coming, 'here's your mother! I wonder what she wants!
She was here less than a month ago. She's scheming after
something or other, I know.'</p>

<p>The Rougons, whose assistant Mouret had been prior to
his marriage, when their shabby little shop in the old quarter
of the town had ever suggested bankruptcy, were the objects
of his constant suspicions. They returned the feeling with
bitter and deep-seated animosity, their rancour being especially
aroused by the speedy success which had attended him
in business. When their son-in-law said, 'I simply owe my
fortune to my own exertions,' they bit their lips and understood
quite well that he was accusing them of having gained
theirs by less honourable means. Notwithstanding the fine
house she now had on the Place of the Sub-Prefecture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Félicité silently envied the peaceful little home of the
Mourets, with all the bitter jealousy of a retired shopkeeper
who owed her fortune to something else than the profits of
her business.</p>

<p>Félicité kissed Marthe on the forehead and then gave her
hand to Mouret. She and her son-in-law generally affected a
mocking tone in their conversations together.</p>

<p>'Well,' she said to him with a smile, 'the gendarmes
haven't been for you yet then, you revolutionist?'</p>

<p>'No, not yet,' he replied with a responsive smile; 'they
are waiting till your husband gives them the order.'</p>

<p>'It's very nice and polite of you to say that!' exclaimed
Félicité, whose eyes were beginning to glisten.</p>

<p>Marthe turned a beseeching glance upon Mouret. He had
gone too far; but his feelings were roused and he added:</p>

<p>'Good gracious! What are we thinking of to receive you
in the dining-room? Let us go into the drawing-room, I
beg you.'</p>

<p>This was one of his usual pleasantries. He affected all
Félicité's fine airs whenever he received a visit from her. It
was to no purpose that Marthe protested that they were very
comfortable where they were; her husband insisted that she
and her mother should follow him into the drawing-room.
When they got there, he bustled about, opening the shutters
and drawing out the chairs. The drawing-room, which was
seldom entered, and the shutters of which were generally
kept closed, was a great wilderness of a room, with furniture
swathed in white dust-covers which were turning yellow from
the proximity of the damp garden.</p>

<p>'It is really disgraceful!' muttered Mouret, wiping the
dust from a small console; 'that wretched Rose neglects
everything abominably.'</p>

<p>Then, turning towards his mother-in-law, he said with
ill-concealed irony:</p>

<p>'You will excuse us for receiving you in this way in our
poor dwelling. We cannot all be wealthy.'</p>

<p>Félicité was choking with rage. She scanned Mouret
for a moment, and almost indulged in a burst of anger; but
she made an effort to restrain herself and slowly dropped her
eyes. When she again raised them she spoke in a pleasant
tone.</p>

<p>'I have just been calling upon Madame de Condamin,' she
said, 'and I thought I would look in here and see how you all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
were. The children are well, I hope, and you, too, my dear
Mouret?'</p>

<p>'Yes, we are all wonderfully well,' he replied, quite
astonished by this amiability.</p>

<p>But the old lady gave him no time to import any fresh
unpleasantness into the conversation, for she began to question
Marthe affectionately about all sorts of trifles, playing
the part of a fond grandmother and scolding Mouret for not
sending the dear children to see her oftener, for she was
always so delighted to have them with her, said she.</p>

<p>'Well, here we are in October again,' she remarked carelessly,
after awhile, 'and I shall be having my day again,
Thursdays, as in former seasons. I shall count upon seeing
you, my dear Marthe, of course; and you too, Mouret, you
will look in occasionally, won't you, and not go on sulking
with us for ever?'</p>

<p>Mouret, who was growing a little suspicious of all his
mother-in-law's affectionate chatter, was at a loss how to
reply. He had not expected such a thrust, but there was
nothing in it to which he could take exception; so he merely
said:</p>

<p>'You know very well that I can't go to your house; you
receive a lot of people who would be delighted to have an
opportunity of making themselves disagreeable to me. And,
besides, I don't want to mix myself up with politics.'</p>

<p>'You are quite mistaken, Mouret, quite mistaken!' Félicité
replied. 'My drawing-room is not a club; I would never
allow it to become one. All the town knows that I do all I
can to make my house as pleasant as possible; and if political
matters ever are discussed there, it is only in corners, I assure
you. Ah! believe me, I had quite enough of politics long
ago. What makes you say such a thing?'</p>

<p>'Why, you receive all the Sub-Prefecture set,' Mouret
said shortly.</p>

<p>'The Sub-Prefecture set!' she repeated, 'the Sub-Prefecture
set! Certainly I receive those gentlemen. But
I don't think that Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies will be
found very often in my house this winter. My husband has
told him pretty plainly what he thought of his conduct in
connection with the last elections. He allowed himself to be
tricked like a mere nincompoop. But his friends are very
pleasant men. Monsieur Delangre and Monsieur de Condamin
are extremely amiable, and that worthy Paloque is kindness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
itself, while I'm sure you can have nothing to say against
Doctor Porquier.'</p>

<p>Mouret shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>'Besides,' she continued, with ironic emphasis, 'I also
receive Monsieur Rastoil's circle, worthy Monsieur Maffre and
our clever friend Monsieur de Bourdeu, the former prefect.
So you see we are not at all bigoted or exclusive, the representatives
of all opinions find a welcome among us. Of
course when I am inviting a party of people, I don't ask those
to meet each other who would be likely to quarrel. But wit
and cleverness are welcome in whomsoever they are found,
and we pride ourselves upon having at our gatherings all the
most distinguished persons in Plassans. My drawing-room
is neutral ground, remember that, Mouret; yes, neutral
ground that is the right expression.'</p>

<p>She had grown quite animated whilst talking. Her
drawing-room was her great glory, and it was her desire to
reign there, not as a chief of a party, but as a queen of society.
It is true that her friends said that she was adopting conciliatory
tactics merely in conformity with the advice of her
son Eugène, the minister,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> who had charged her to personify
at Plassans the gentleness and amiability of the Empire.</p>

<p>'You may say what you like,' Mouret growled, 'but that
Maffre of yours is a bigot, and your Bourdeu is a fool, and
most of all the others are a pack of rascals. That's my
opinion of them. I am much obliged to you for your invitation,
but it would disturb my habits too much to accept it.
I like to go to bed in good time, and I prefer stopping at home.'</p>

<p>Félicité rose from her seat, and turning her back upon
Mouret, she said to her daughter:</p>

<p>'Well, at any rate I may expect you, mayn't I, my dear?'</p>

<p>'Of course you may,' replied Marthe, who wished to soften
the bluntness of her husband's blunt refusal.</p>

<p>The old lady was just going to leave, when a thought
seemed to strike her, and she asked if she might kiss Désirée,
whom she had seen playing in the garden. She would not let
them call the girl into the house, but insisted on going herself
to the terrace, which was still damp from a slight shower
which had fallen in the morning. When she found Désirée,
she was profuse in her caresses of the girl, who seemed
rather frightened of her. Then she raised her head as if by
chance and looked at the curtains at the second-floor windows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>'Ah! you have let the rooms, then? Oh, yes! I remember
now; to a priest, isn't it? I've heard it spoken of. What
sort of a person is he, this priest of yours?'</p>

<p>Mouret looked at her keenly. A sudden suspicion flashed
through his mind, and he began to guess that it was entirely
on account of Abbé Faujas that his mother-in-law had favoured
them with this visit.</p>

<p>'Upon my word,' he replied, without taking his eyes off
her, 'I really know nothing about him. But perhaps you
are able to give me some information concerning him yourself?'</p>

<p>'I!' she cried, with an appearance of great surprise.
'Why, I've never even seen him! Stay, though, I know he
is one of the curates at Saint-Saturnin; Father Bourrette told
me that. By the way, that reminds me that I ought to ask
him to my Thursdays. The director of the seminary and the
bishop's secretary are already amongst my circle of visitors.'</p>

<p>And, turning to Marthe, she added:</p>

<p>'When you see your lodger you might sound him, so as
to be able to tell me whether an invitation from me would be
acceptable.'</p>

<p>'We scarcely ever see him,' Mouret hastily interposed.
'He comes in and goes out without ever opening his mouth.
And, besides, it is really no business of ours.'</p>

<p>He still kept his eyes fixed suspiciously upon her. He
felt quite sure that she knew much more about Abbé Faujas
than she was willing to admit. However, she did not once
flinch beneath his searching gaze.</p>

<p>'Very well, it's all the same to me,' she said, with an
appearance of unconcern. 'I shall be able to find out some
other way of inviting him, if he's the right sort of person,
I've no doubt. Good-bye, my children.'</p>

<p>As she was mounting the steps again, a tall old man
appeared on the hall threshold. He was dressed very neatly
in blue cloth, and had a fur cap pressed over his eyes. In
his hand he carried a whip.</p>

<p>'Hallo! why there's Uncle Macquart!' cried Mouret,
casting a curious glance at his mother-in-law.</p>

<p>An expression of extreme annoyance passed over Félicité's
face. Macquart, Rougon's illegitimate brother, had, by the
latter's aid, returned to France after he had compromised
himself in the rising of 1851. Since arriving from Piedmont
he had been leading the life of a sleek and well-to-do citizen.
He had purchased, though where the money had come from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
no one knew, a small house at the village of Les Tulettes,
about three leagues from Plassans. And by degrees he had
fitted up an establishment there, and had now even become
possessed of a horse and trap, and was constantly to be met
on the high roads, smoking his pipe, enjoying the sunshine,
and sniggering like a tamed wolf. Rougon's enemies
whispered that the two brothers had perpetrated some black
business together, and that Pierre Rougon was keeping
Antoine Macquart.</p>

<p>'Good day, Uncle!' said Mouret affectedly; 'have you
come to pay us a little visit?'</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed,' Macquart replied, in a voice as guileless as
a child's. 'You know that whenever I come to Plassans&mdash;&mdash;Hallo,
Félicité! I didn't expect to find you here! I came
over to see Rougon. There was something I wanted to talk
to him about.'</p>

<p>'He was at home, wasn't he?' she exclaimed with uneasy
haste.</p>

<p>'Yes, he was at home,' Uncle Macquart replied tranquilly.
'I saw him, and we had a talk together. He is a good fellow,
is Rougon.'</p>

<p>He laughed slightly, and while Félicité stamped her feet
with restless anxiety, he went on talking in his drawling
voice, which made it seem as if he was always laughing at
those whom he addressed.</p>

<p>'Mouret, my boy, I have brought you a couple of rabbits,'
he said. 'They are in a basket over there. I have given them
to Rose. I brought another couple with me for Rougon.
You will find them at home, Félicité, and you must tell me
how they turn out. They are beautifully plump; I fattened
them up for you. Ah, my dears! it pleases me very much
to be able to make you these little presents.'</p>

<p>Félicité turned quite pale, and pressed her lips tightly,
while Mouret continued to look at her with a quiet smile.
She would have been glad to get away, if she had not been
afraid of Macquart gossiping as soon as her back should be
turned.</p>

<p>'Thank you, Uncle,' said Mouret. 'The plums that you
brought us the last time you came were very good. Won't
you have something to drink?'</p>

<p>'Well, that's an offer I really can't refuse.'</p>

<p>When Rose had brought him out a glass of wine, he sat
down on the balustrade of the terrace and slowly sipped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
beverage, smacking his tongue and holding up the glass to
the light.</p>

<p>'This comes from the district of Saint-Eutrope,' he said.
'I'm not to be deceived in matters of this kind. I know the
different districts thoroughly.'</p>

<p>He wagged his head and again sniggered.</p>

<p>Then Mouret, with an intonation that was full of meaning,
suddenly asked him:</p>

<p>'And how are things getting on at Les Tulettes?'</p>

<p>Macquart raised his eyes and looked at them all. Then
giving a final cluck of his tongue and putting down the glass
on the stone-work by his side, he said, quite unconcernedly:</p>

<p>'Oh! very well. I heard of her the day before yesterday.
She is still just the same.'</p>

<p>Félicité had turned her head away. For a moment no
one spoke. Mouret had just put his finger upon one of the
family's sore places, by alluding to old Adelaide, the mother
of Rougon and Macquart, who for several years now had
been shut up as a mad woman in the asylum at Les Tulettes.
Macquart's little property was near the mad-house, and it
seemed as though Rougon had posted the old scamp there to
keep watch over their mother.</p>

<p>'It is getting late,' Macquart said at last, rising from his
seat on the balustrade, 'and I want to get back again before
night. I shall expect to see you over at my house one of
these days, Mouret, my boy. You have promised me several
times to come, you know.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes! I'll come, Uncle, I'll come.'</p>

<p>'Ah! but that isn't enough. I want you all to come; all
of you, do you hear? I am very dull out there all by myself.
I will give you some dinner.'</p>

<p>Then, turning to Félicité, he added:</p>

<p>'Tell Rougon that I shall expect him and you, too. You
needn't stop from coming just because the old mother happens
to be near there. She is going on very well, I tell you, and
is properly looked after. You may safely trust yourselves to me,
and I will give you some wine from one of the slopes of La
Seille, a light wine that will warm you up famously.'</p>

<p>He began to walk towards the gate as he spoke. Félicité
followed him so closely that it almost seemed as if she were
pushing him out of the garden. They all accompanied him
to the street. While he was untethering his horse, which he
had fastened by the reins to one of the house shutters, Abbé<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Faujas, who was just returning home, passed the group with a
slight bow. He glided on as noiselessly as a black shadow,
but Félicité quickly turned and watched him till he reached
the staircase. Unfortunately she had not had time to catch
sight of his face. Macquart on perceiving the priest had
shaken his head in utter surprise.</p>

<p>'What! my boy,' said he, 'have you really got priests
lodging with you now? That man has very strange eyes.
Take care! take care! cassocks bring ill luck with them!'</p>

<p>Then he took his seat in his trap and clucked his horse
on, going down the Rue Balande at a gentle trot. His round
back and fur cap disappeared at the corner of the Rue Taravelle.
As Mouret turned round again, he heard his mother-in-law
speaking to Marthe.</p>

<p>'I would rather you do it,' she was saying; 'the invitation
would seem less formal. I should be very glad if you could
find some opportunity of speaking to him.'</p>

<p>She checked herself when she saw that she was overheard;
and having kissed Désirée effusively, she went away, giving a
last look round to make quite sure that Macquart was not
likely to come back to gossip about her.</p>

<p>'I forbid you to mix yourself up in your mother's affairs,
you know,' Mouret said to his wife as they returned into the
house. 'She has always got some business or other on hand
that no body can understand. What in the world can she
want with the Abbé? She wouldn't invite him for his own
sake, I'm sure. She must have some secret reason for doing
so. That priest hasn't come from Besançon to Plassans for
nothing. There is some mystery or other at the bottom of
it all!'</p>

<p>Marthe had again set to work at the everlasting repairs of
the family-linen which kept her busy for days together. But
her husband went on chattering:</p>

<p>'Old Macquart and your mother amuse me very much.
How they hate each other! Did you notice how angry she
was when she saw him come? She always seems to be in a
state of fear lest he should make some unpleasant revelation&mdash;&mdash;I
dare say that he'd willingly do so. But they'll
never catch me in his house. I've sworn to keep clear of all
that business. My father was quite right when he said that
my mother's family, those Rougons and Macquarts, were not
worth a rope to hang them with&mdash;&mdash;They are my relations
as well as yours, so you needn't feel hurt at what I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
saying. I say it because it is true. They are wealthy people
now, but their money hasn't made them any better&mdash;rather
the contrary.'</p>

<p>Then he set off to take a turn along the Cours Sauvaire,
where he met his friends and talked to them about the
weather and the crops and the events of the previous day.
An extensive transaction in almonds, which he undertook on
the morrow, kept him busy for more than a week and made
him almost forget all about Abbé Faujas. He was beginning,
besides, to feel a little weary of the Abbé, who did not talk
enough and was far too secretive. On two separate occasions
he purposely avoided him, imagining that the priest only
wanted to see him in order to make him relate the stories of
the remainder of the Sub-Prefecture circle and Monsieur
Rastoil's friends. Rose had informed him that Madame
Faujas had tried to get her to talk, and this had made him
vow that he would in future keep his mouth shut. This
resolve furnished fresh amusement for his idle hours, and
now, as he looked up at the closely drawn curtains of the
second-floor windows, he would mutter:</p>

<p>'All right, my good fellow! Hide yourself as much as
you like! I know very well that you're watching me from
behind those curtains, but you won't be much the wiser for
your trouble, and you'll find yourself much mistaken if you
expect to get any more information out of me about our
neighbours!'</p>

<p>He derived great pleasure from the thought that the Abbé
Faujas was secretly watching, and he took every precaution to
avoid falling into any trap that might be laid for him. One
evening as he was coming home he saw Abbé Bourrette and
Abbé Faujas standing before Monsieur Rastoil's gate. So he
concealed himself behind the corner of a house and spied on
them. The two priests kept him waiting there for more than
a quarter of an hour. They talked with great animation,
parted for a moment, and then joined each other again, and
resumed their conversation. Mouret thought he could detect
that Abbé Bourrette was trying to persuade Abbé Faujas to
accompany him to the judge's; and that Faujas was making
excuses for not going, and at last refusing to do so with some
show of impatience. It was a Tuesday, the day of the weekly
dinner. Finally Bourrette entered Monsieur Rastoil's house,
and Faujas went off in his quiet fashion to his own rooms.
Mouret stood for awhile thinking. What could be Abbé<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Faujas's reason for refusing to go to Monsieur Rastoil's? All
the clergy of Saint-Saturnin's dined there, Abbé Fenil, Abbé
Surin, and all the others. There was not a single priest in
Plassans who had not enjoyed the fresh air by the fountain
in the garden there. The new curate's refusal to go seemed
a very extraordinary thing.</p>

<p>When Mouret got home again, he hurried to the bottom
of his own garden to reconnoitre the second-floor windows.
And after a moment or two he saw the curtain of the second
window move to the right. He felt quite sure that Abbé Faujas
was behind it, spying upon what might be going on at
Monsieur Rastoil's. Then Mouret thought that he could discover
by certain movements of the curtain that the Abbé was
in turn inspecting the gardens of the Sub-Prefecture.</p>

<p>The next day, a Wednesday, Rose told him just as he was
going out that Abbé Bourrette had been with the second-floor
people for at least an hour. Upon this he came
back into the house and began to rummage about in the
dining-room. When Marthe asked him what he was looking
for, he replied sharply that he was trying to find a paper
without which he could not go out. He even went upstairs,
as if to see whether he had left it there. After waiting for a
long time behind his bedroom door, he thought he could hear
some chairs moving on the second floor, and thereupon he
slowly went downstairs, stopping for a moment or two in the
hall to give Abbé Bourrette time to catch him up.</p>

<p>'Ah! is that you, Monsieur l'Abbé? This is a fortunate
meeting! You are going to Saint-Saturnin's, I suppose, and
I am going that way too. We will keep each other company,
if you have no objection.'</p>

<p>Abbé Bourrette replied that he would be delighted, and
they both walked slowly up the Rue Balande towards the
Place of the Sub-Prefecture. The Abbé was a stout man, with
an honest, open face, and big, child-like blue eyes. His wide
silk girdle which was drawn tightly round him threw his well-rounded
stomach into relief. His arms were unduly short
and his legs heavy and clumsy, and he walked with his head
thrown slightly back.</p>

<p>'So you've just been to see our good Monsieur Faujas?'
said Mouret, going to the point at once. 'I must really thank
you for having procured me such a lodger as is rarely to be
found.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' said the priest, 'he is a very good and worthy
man.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>'He never makes the slightest noise, and we can't really
tell that there is anyone in the house. And he is so polite
and courteous, too. I've heard it said, do you know, that he
is a man of unusual attainments, and that he has been sent
here as a sort of compliment to the diocese.'</p>

<p>They had now reached the middle of the Place of the
Sub-Prefecture. Mouret stopped short and looked at Abbé
Bourrette keenly.</p>

<p>'Ah, indeed!' the priest merely replied, with an air of
astonishment.</p>

<p>'So I've been told. The Bishop, it is said, intends to
do something for him later on. In the meantime, the new
curate has to keep himself in the background for fear of
exciting jealousy.'</p>

<p>Abbé Bourrette went on walking again, and turned the
corner of the Rue de la Banne.</p>

<p>'You surprise me very much,' he quietly remarked. 'Faujas
is a very unassuming man; in fact, he is far too humble. For
instance, at the church he has taken upon himself the petty
duties which are generally left to the ordinary staff. He is a
saint, but he is not very sharp. I scarcely ever see him at
the Bishop's, and from the first he has always been very cold
with Abbé Fenil, though I strongly impressed upon him that
it was necessary he should be on good terms with the Grand-Vicar
if he wished to be well received at the Bishop's. But
he didn't seem to see it, and I'm afraid that he's deficient in
judgment. He shows the same failing, too, by his continual
visits to Abbé Compan, who has been confined to his bed
for the last fortnight, and whom I'm afraid we are going to
lose. Abbé Faujas's visits are most ill-advised, and will do
him a deal of harm. Compan has always been on bad
terms with Fenil, and it's only a stranger from Besançon
who could be ignorant of a fact that is known to the whole
diocese.'</p>

<p>Bourrette was growing animated, and in his turn he
stopped short as they reached the Rue Canquoin and took
his stand in front of Mouret.</p>

<p>'No, no, my dear sir,' he said, 'you have been misinformed:
Faujas is as simple as a new-born babe. I'm not an ambitious
man myself, and God knows how fond I am of Compan, who
has a heart of gold, but, all the same, I keep my visits to him
private. He said to me himself: "Bourrette, my old friend,
I am not much longer for this world. If you want to succeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
me, don't be seen too often knocking at my door. Come after
dark and knock three times, and my sister will let you in."
So now, you understand, I wait till night before I go to see
him. One has plenty of troubles as it is, without incurring
unnecessary ones!'</p>

<p>His voice quavered, and he clasped his hands across his
stomach as he resumed his walk, moved by a naïve egotism
which made him commiserate himself, while he murmured:</p>

<p>'Poor Compan! poor Compan!'</p>

<p>Mouret was feeling quite perplexed. All his theories about
Abbé Faujas were being upset.</p>

<p>'I had such very precise details furnished to me,' he
ventured to say. 'I was told that he was to be promoted to
some important office.'</p>

<p>'Oh dear, no!' cried the priest. 'I can assure you that
there is no truth in anything of the kind. Faujas has no
expectations of any sort. I'll tell you something that proves
it. You know that I dine at the Presiding Judge's every
Tuesday. Well, last week he particularly asked me to bring
Faujas with me. He wanted to see him, and find out what
sort of a person he was, I suppose. Now, you would scarcely
guess what Faujas did. He refused the invitation, my dear
sir, bluntly refused it. It was all to no purpose that I told
him he would make his life at Plassans quite intolerable, and
would certainly embroil himself with Fenil by acting so rudely
to Monsieur Rastoil. He persisted in having his own way,
and wouldn't be persuaded by anything that I said. I believe
that he even exclaimed, in a moment of anger, that he wasn't
reduced to accepting dinners of that kind.'</p>

<p>Abbé Bourrette began to smile. They had now reached
Saint-Saturnin's, and he detained Mouret for a moment near
the little side door of the church.</p>

<p>'He is a child, a big child,' he continued. 'I ask you,
now, could a dinner at Monsieur Rastoil's possibly compromise
him in any way? When your mother-in-law, that good
Madame Rougon, entrusted me yesterday with an invitation
for Faujas, I did not conceal from her my fear that it would
be badly received.'</p>

<p>Mouret pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>'Ah! my mother-in-law gave you an invitation for him,
did she?'</p>

<p>'Yes, she came to the sacristy yesterday. As I make a
point of doing what I can to oblige her, I promised her that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
would go and see the obstinate man this morning. I felt
quite certain, however, that he would refuse.'</p>

<p>'And did he?'</p>

<p>'No, indeed; much to my surprise, he accepted.'</p>

<p>Mouret opened his lips and then closed them again without
speaking. The priest winked with an appearance of
extreme satisfaction.</p>

<p>'I had to manage the matter very skilfully, you know.
For more than an hour I went on explaining your mother-in-law's
position to him. He kept shaking his head, however;
he could not make up his mind to go, and he was ever
dwelling upon his desire for privacy. I had exhausted my
stock of arguments when I recalled one point of the instructions
which the dear lady gave me. She had told me to tell
him that her drawing-room was entirely neutral ground, and
that this was a fact well known to the whole town. When I
pressed this upon his notice he seemed to waver, and at last
he consented to accept the invitation, and even promised to
go to-morrow. I shall send a few lines to that excellent
Madame Rougon to inform her of my success.'</p>

<p>He lingered for a moment longer, rolling his big blue eyes,
and saying&mdash;more to himself than to Mouret:</p>

<p>'Monsieur Rastoil will be very much vexed, but it's no
fault of mine.'</p>

<p>Then he added: 'Good-morning, dear Monsieur Mouret;
remember me very kindly to all your family.'</p>

<p>He entered the church, letting the padded doors close
softly behind him. Mouret gazed at the doors and lightly
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>'There's a fine old chatterbox!' he muttered; 'one of
those men who never give one a chance of getting in a word,
but go on chattering away for hours without ever telling one
anything worth listening to. So Faujas is going to Félicité's
to-morrow! It's really very provoking that I am not on good
terms with that fool Rougon!'</p>

<p>All the afternoon he was occupied with business matters,
but at night, just as he and his wife were going to bed, he said
to Marthe carelessly:</p>

<p>'Are you going to your mother's to-morrow evening?'</p>

<p>'No, not to-morrow,' Marthe replied, 'I have too many
things to do. But I dare say I shall go next week.'</p>

<p>He made no immediate reply, but just before he blew out
the candle, he resumed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>'It is wrong not to go out oftener than you do. Go to
your mother's to-morrow evening; it will enliven you a little.
I will stay at home and look after the children.'</p>

<p>Marthe looked at him in astonishment. He generally kept
her at home with him, requiring all kinds of little services
from her, and grumbling if she went out even for an hour.</p>

<p>'Very well,' she replied, 'I will go if you wish me to.'</p>

<p>Then he blew out the candle, laid his head upon the
pillow, and muttered:</p>

<p>'That's right; and you can tell us all about it when you
come back. It will amuse the children.'</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="VI" id="VI">VI</a></h3>


<p>About nine o'clock on the following evening, Abbé Bourrette
called for Abbé Faujas. He had promised to go with him to
the Rougons' and introduce him there. He found him ready,
standing in the middle of his big bare room, and putting on a
pair of black gloves that were sadly whitened at the finger-tips.
Bourrette could not restrain a slight grimace as he looked at
him.</p>

<p>'Haven't you got another cassock?' he asked.</p>

<p>'No,' quietly replied Abbé Faujas. 'This one is still very
decent, I think.'</p>

<p>'Oh, certainly! certainly!' stammered the old priest;
'but it's very cold outside. Hadn't you better put something
round your shoulders? Well! well! come along then!'</p>

<p>The nights had just commenced to be frosty. Abbé Bourrette,
who was warmly wrapped in a padded silk overcoat, got
quite out of breath as he panted along after Abbé Faujas,
who wore nothing over his shoulders but his thin, threadbare
cassock. They stopped at the corner of the Rue de la Banne
and the Place of the Sub-Prefecture, in front of a house built
entirely of white stone, one of the handsome mansions of the
new part of the town. A servant in blue livery received them
at the door and ushered them into the hall. He smiled at
Abbé Bourrette as he helped him to take off his overcoat, and
seemed greatly surprised at the appearance of the other priest,
that tall, rough-hewn man, who had ventured out on such a
bitter night without a cloak.</p>

<p>The drawing-room was on the first floor, and Abbé Faujas
entered it with head erect, and grave, though perfectly easy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
demeanour, while Abbé Bourrette, who was always very
nervous when he went to the Rougons' house, although he
never missed a single one of their receptions, made his
escape into an adjoining apartment, thus cowardly leaving his
companion in the lurch. Faujas, however, slowly traversed
the whole drawing-room in order to pay his respects to the
mistress of the house, whom he felt sure he could recognise
among a group of five or six ladies. He was obliged to introduce
himself, and he did so in two or three words. Félicité
had immediately risen from her seat, and she closely if quickly
scanned him from head to foot. Then her eyes sought his
own, as she smilingly said:</p>

<p>'I am delighted, Monsieur l'Abbé; I am delighted indeed.'</p>

<p>The priest's passage through the drawing-room had created
considerable sensation. One young lady who had suddenly
raised her head, had quite trembled with alarm at the sight
of that great black mass in front of her. The impression
created by the Abbé was, indeed, an unfavourable one. He
was too tall, too square-shouldered, his face was too hard and
his hands were too big. His cassock, moreover, looked so
frightfully shabby beneath the bright light of the chandelier
that the ladies felt a kind of shame at seeing a priest so
shockingly dressed. They spread out their fans, and began to
giggle behind them, while pretending to be quite unconscious
of the Abbé's presence. The men, meantime, exchanged very
significant glances.</p>

<p>Félicité saw what a very churlish welcome the priest was
receiving; she seemed annoyed at it, and remained standing,
raising her voice in order to force her guests to hear the
compliments which she addressed to Faujas.</p>

<p>'That dear Bourrette,' said she, in her most winning tone,
'has told me what difficulty he had in persuading you to come.
I am really quite cross with you, sir. You have no right to
deprive society of the pleasure of your company.'</p>

<p>The priest bowed without making any reply, and the old
lady laughed as she began to speak again, laying a meaning
emphasis on certain of her words.</p>

<p>'I know more about you than you imagine, in spite of all
the care you have taken to hide your light under a bushel. I
have been told about you; you are a very holy man, and I
want to be your friend. We shall have an opportunity to talk
about this, for I hope that you will now consider yourself as
one of our circle.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>Abbé Faujas looked at her fixedly, as though he had recognised
some masonic sign in the movements of her fan. He
lowered his voice as he replied:</p>

<p>'Madame, I am entirely at your service.'</p>

<p>'I am delighted to hear you say so,' said Madame Rougon
with another laugh. 'You will find that we do our best here
to make everyone happy. But come with me and let me present
you to my husband.'</p>

<p>She crossed the room, disturbing several of her guests in
her progress to make way for Abbé Faujas, thus giving him
an importance which put the finishing touch to the prejudice
against him. In the adjoining room some card-tables were
set out. She went straight up to her husband, who was
gravely playing whist. He seemed rather impatient as she
stooped down to whisper in his ear, but the few words she
said to him made him spring briskly from his seat.</p>

<p>'Very good! very good!' he murmured.</p>

<p>Then, having first apologised to those with whom he was
playing, he went and shook hands with Abbé Faujas.</p>

<p>At that time Rougon was a stout, pale man of seventy,
and had acquired all a millionaire's gravity of expression. He
was generally considered by the Plassans people to have a fine
head, the white, uncommunicative head of a man of political
importance. After he had exchanged a few courtesies with
the priest he resumed his seat at the card-table. Félicité had
just gone back into the drawing-room, her face still wreathed
with smiles.</p>

<p>When Abbé Faujas at last found himself alone he did not
manifest the slightest sign of embarrassment. He remained
for a moment watching the whist-players, or appearing to do
so, for he was, in reality, examining the curtains, and carpet,
and furniture. It was a small wainscotted room, and book-cases
of dark pear-tree wood, ornamented with brass beadings,
occupied three of its sides. It looked like a magistrate's private
sanctum. At last the priest, who was apparently desirous of
making a complete inspection, returned to the drawing-room and
crossed it. It was hung with green, and was in keeping with
the smaller <i>salon</i>, but there was more gilding about it, so that
it suggested the soberness of a minister's private room combined
with the brightness of a great restaurant. On the other
side of it was a sort of boudoir where Félicité received her
friends during the day. This was hung in straw colour, and
was so full of easy-chairs and ottomans and couches, covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
with brocade with a pattern of violet scroll-work, that there
was scarcely room to move about in it.</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas took a seat near the fireplace and pretended
to be warming his feet. He had placed himself in such a
position that through the open doorway he could command a
view of the greater part of the large drawing-room. He reflected
upon Madame Rougon's gracious reception, and half
closed his eyes, as though he were thinking out some problem
which it was rather difficult to solve. A moment or two afterwards,
while he was still absorbed in his reverie, he heard
someone speaking behind him. His large-backed easy-chair
concealed him from sight, and he kept his eyes still more
tightly closed than before, as he remained there listening,
looking for all the world as though the warmth of the fire had
sent him to sleep.</p>

<p>'I went to their house just once at that time,' an unctuous
voice was saying. 'They were then living opposite this place,
on the other side of the Rue de la Banne. You were at Paris
then; but all Plassans at that period knew of the Rougons'
yellow drawing-room. A wretched room it was, hung with
lemon-coloured paper at fifteen sous the piece, and containing
some rickety furniture covered with cheap velvet. But look
at black Félicité now, dressed in plum-coloured satin and
seated on yonder couch! Do you see how she gives her hand
to little Delangre? Upon my word, she is giving it to him to
kiss!'</p>

<p>Then a younger voice said with something of a sneer:
'They must have managed to lay their hands on a pretty
big share of plunder to be able to have such a beautiful
drawing-room; it is the handsomest, you know, in the whole
town.'</p>

<p>'The lady,' the other voice resumed, 'has always had a
passion for receptions. When she was hard up she drank
water herself so that she might be able to provide lemonade
for her guests. Oh! I know all about the Rougons. I have
watched their whole career. They are very clever people, and
the Coup d'État has enabled them to satisfy the dreams of
luxury and pleasure which had been tormenting them for forty
years. Now you see what a magnificent style they keep up,
how lavishly they live! This house which they now occupy
formerly belonged to a Monsieur Peirotte, one of the receivers
of taxes, who was killed in the affair at Sainte-Roure in the
insurrection of '51. Upon my word, they've had the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
extraordinary luck: a stray bullet removed the man who was
standing in their way, and they stepped into his place and
house. If it had been a choice between the receivership and
the house, Félicité would certainly have chosen the house.
She had been hankering after it for half a score years nearly,
making herself quite ill by her covetous glances at the
magnificent curtains that hung at the windows. It was her
Tuileries, as the Plassans people used to say, after the 2nd of
December.'</p>

<p>'But where did they get the money to buy this house?'</p>

<p>'Ah! no one knows that, my dear fellow. Their son
Eugène, who has had such amazing political success in Paris,
and has become a deputy, a minister and a confidential
adviser at the Tuileries, had no difficulty in obtaining the
receivership and the cross of the Legion of Honour for his
father, who had played his cards very cleverly here. As for
the house, they probably paid for it by borrowing the money
from some banker. Anyhow, they are wealthy people to-day,
and are fast making up for lost time. I fancy their son keeps
up a constant correspondence with them, for they have not
made a single false step as yet.'</p>

<p>The person who was speaking paused for a moment, then
resumed with a low laugh:</p>

<p>'Ah! I really can't help laughing when I see that precious
grasshopper of a Félicité putting on all her fine duchess's
airs! I always think of the old yellow drawing-room with
its threadbare carpet and shabby furniture and little fly-specked
chandelier. And now, to-day, she receives the
Rastoil young ladies. Just look how she is manœuvring the
train of her dress! Some day, my dear fellow, that old
woman will burst of sheer triumph in the middle of her green
drawing-room!'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas had gently let his head turn so that he
might peep at what was going on in the drawing-room.
There he observed Madame Rougon standing in all her
majesty in the centre of a group of guests. She seemed to
have increased in stature, and every back around bent before
her glance, which was like that of some victorious queen.</p>

<p>'Ah! here's your father!' said the person with the
unctuous voice; 'the good doctor is just arriving. I'm quite
surprised that he has never told you of all these matters. He
knows far more about them than I do.'</p>

<p>'Oh! my father is always afraid lest I should compromise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
him,' replied the other gaily. 'You know how he rails at me
and swears that I shall make him lose all his patients. Ah!
excuse me, please; I see the young Maffres over there, I
must go and shake hands with them.'</p>

<p>There was a sound of chairs being moved, and Abbé
Faujas saw a tall young man, whose face already bore signs
of physical weariness, cross the small room. The other
person, the one who had given such a lively account of the
Rougons, also rose from his seat. A lady who happened to
pass near him allowed him to pay her some pretty compliments;
and she smiled at him and called him 'dear Monsieur
de Condamin.' Thereupon the priest recognised him as the
fine man of sixty whom Mouret had pointed out to him in the
garden of the Sub-Prefecture. Monsieur de Condamin came
and sat down on the other side of the fireplace. He was
startled to see Abbé Faujas, who had been quite concealed by
the back of his chair, but he appeared in no way disconcerted.
He smiled and, with amicable self-possession, exclaimed:</p>

<p>'I think, Monsieur l'Abbé, that we have just been unintentionally
confessing ourselves. It's a great sin, isn't it, to
backbite one's neighbour? Fortunately you were there to
give us absolution.'</p>

<p>The Abbé, in spite of the control which he usually had
over his features, could not restrain a slight blush. He perfectly
understood that Monsieur de Condamin was reproaching
him for having kept so quiet in order to listen to what
was being said. Monsieur de Condamin, however, was not a
man to preserve a grudge against anyone for their curiosity,
but quite the contrary. He was delighted at the complicity
which the matter seemed to have established between himself
and the Abbé. It put him at liberty to talk freely and to
while away the evening in relating scandalous stories about
the persons present. There was nothing that he enjoyed so
much, and this Abbé, who had only recently arrived at
Plassans, seemed likely to prove a good listener, the more
especially as he had an ugly face, the face of a man who
would listen to anything, and wore such a shabby cassock
that it would be preposterous to think that any confidence to
which he might be treated would lead to unpleasantness.</p>

<p>By the end of a quarter of an hour Monsieur de Condamin
became quite at his ease, and gave Abbé Faujas a detailed
account of Plassans with all the suave politeness of a man
of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>'You are a stranger amongst us, Monsieur l'Abbé,' said
he, 'and I shall be delighted if I can be of any assistance to
you. Plassans is a little hole of a place, but one gets reconciled
to it in time. I myself come from the neighbourhood
of Dijon, and when I was appointed conservator of woods and
rivers in this district, I found the place detestable, and thought
I should be bored to death here. That was just before the
Empire. After '51, the provinces were by no means cheerful
places to live in, I assure you. In this department the folks
were alarmed if they heard a dog bark, and they were ready
to sink into the ground at the sight of a gendarme. But they
calmed down by degrees, and resumed their old, monotonous,
uneventful existences, and in the end I grew quite resigned to
my life here. I live chiefly in the open air, I take long rides
on horseback, and I have made a few pleasant friendships.'</p>

<p>He lowered his voice, and continued confidentially:</p>

<p>'If you will take my advice, Monsieur l'Abbé, you will be
careful what you do. You can't imagine what a scrape I
once nearly fell into. Plassans, you know, is divided into
three absolutely distinct divisions: the old district, where
your duties will be confined to administering consolation and
alms; the district of Saint-Marc, where our aristocrats live, a
district that is full of boredom and ill-feeling, and where you
can't be too much upon your guard; and, lastly, the new
town, the district which is now springing up round the Sub-Prefecture,
and which is the only one where it is possible to
live with any degree of comfort. At first I was foolish
enough to take up my quarters in the Saint-Marc district,
where I thought that my position required me to reside.
There, alack! I found myself surrounded by a lot of withered
old dowagers and mummified marquises. There wasn't an
atom of sociability, not a scrap of gaiety, nothing but sulky
mutiny against the prosperous peace that the country was
enjoying. I only just missed compromising myself, upon my
word I did. Péqueur used to chaff me, Monsieur Péqueur
des Saulaies, our sub-prefect; you know him, don't you?
Well, then I crossed the Cours Sauvaire, and took rooms on
the Place. At Plassans, you must know, the people have no
existence, and the aristocracy are a dreadful lot that it's quite
impossible to get on with; the only tolerable folks are a few
parvenus, some delightful persons who are ready to incur any
expense in entertaining their official acquaintances. Our
little circle of functionaries is a very delightful one. We live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
amongst ourselves after our own inclinations, without caring
a rap about the townspeople, just as if we had pitched our
camp in some conquered country.'</p>

<p>He laughed complacently, stretched himself further back
in his chair, and turned up his feet to the fire; then he took
a glass of punch from a tray which one of the servants handed
to him, and sipped it slowly while still watching Abbé Faujas
out of the corner of his eye. The latter felt that politeness
required him to say something.</p>

<p>'This house seems a very pleasant one,' he remarked,
turning slightly towards the green drawing-room, whence the
sound of animated conversation was proceeding.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' resumed Monsieur de Condamin, who checked
his remarks every now and then to take a little sip of punch.
'The Rougons almost make us forget Paris. You would
scarcely fancy here that you were in Plassans. It is the only
pleasant and amusing drawing-room in the whole place,
because it is the only one where all shades of opinion elbow
one another. Péqueur, too, has very pleasant assemblies. It
must cost the Rougons a lot of money, and they haven't the
public purse behind them like Péqueur has; though they have
something better still, the pockets of the taxpayers.'</p>

<p>He seemed quite pleased with this witticism of his. He
set his empty glass, which he had been holding in his hand,
upon the mantelpiece, and then, drawing his chair near to
Abbé Faujas and leaning towards him, he began to speak
again:</p>

<p>'The most amusing comedies are continually being played
here. But you ought to know the actors to appreciate them.
You see Madame Rastoil over yonder between her two
daughters&mdash;that lady of about forty-five with a head like a
sheep's? Well, have you noticed how her eyelids trembled
and blinked when Delangre came and sat down in front of
her? Delangre is the man there on the left, with a likeness
to Punch. They were acquainted intimately some ten years
ago, and he is said to be the father of one of the girls, but it
isn't known which. The funniest part of the business is that
Delangre himself didn't get on very well with his wife about
the same time; and people say that the father of his daughter
is an artist very well known in Plassans.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas had considered it his duty to assume a very
serious expression on being made the recipient of such confidences
as these, and he even closed his eyes and seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
hear nothing; while Monsieur de Condamin went on, as
though in justification of himself:</p>

<p>'I allow myself to speak in this way of Delangre, as I
know him so well. He is a wonderfully clever, pushing fellow.
His father was a bricklayer, I believe. Fifteen years ago he
used to take up the petty suits that other lawyers wouldn't be
bothered with. Madame Rastoil extricated him from a condition
of absolute penury; she supplied him even with wood in
the winter-time to enable him to keep himself warm. It was
through her influence that he won his first cases. It's worth
mentioning that at that time Delangre had been shrewd
enough to manifest no particular political proclivities; and
so, in 1852, when people were looking out for a mayor, his
name was at once thought of. He was the only man who
could have been chosen without alarming one or other of the
three divisions of the town. From that time everything has
prospered with him, and he has a fine future before him.
The only unfortunate part of the matter is that he doesn't get
on very well with Péqueur; they are always wrangling about
some silly trifles or other.'</p>

<p>He broke off as he saw the tall young man, with whom he
had been chatting previously, come up to him again.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Guillaume Porquier,' he said, introducing him
to the Abbé, 'the son of Doctor Porquier.'</p>

<p>Then, as Guillaume seated himself, he asked him with a
touch of irony:</p>

<p>'Well! what did you see to admire over yonder?'</p>

<p>'Nothing at all, indeed!' replied the young man with a
smile. 'I saw the Paloques. Madame Rougon always tries
to hide them behind a curtain to prevent anything unpleasant
happening. Paloque never takes his eyes off Monsieur Rastoil,
hoping, no doubt, to kill him with suppressed terror. You
know, of course, that the hideous fellow hopes to die presiding
judge.'</p>

<p>They both laughed. The ugliness of the Paloques was a
perpetual source of amusement amongst the little circle of
officials. Porquier's son lowered his voice as he continued:</p>

<p>'I saw Monsieur Bourdeu, too. Doesn't it strike you that
he's ever so much thinner since the Marquis de Lagrifoul's
election? Bourdeu will never get over the loss of his prefecture;
he had put all his Orleanist rancour at the service of
the Legitimists in the hope that that course would lead him
straight to the Chamber, where he would be able to win back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
that deeply-deplored prefecture. So he was horribly disgusted
and hurt to find that instead of himself they chose the
marquis, who is a perfect ass and hasn't the faintest notion
of politics, whereas he, Bourdeu, is a very shrewd fellow.'</p>

<p>'That Bourdeu, with his tightly-buttoned frock-coat and
broad-brimmed hat, is a most overbearing person,' said
Monsieur de Condamin, shrugging his shoulders. 'If such
people as he were allowed to have their own way they would
turn France into a mere Sorbonne of lawyers and diplomatists,
and would bore us all to death&mdash;&mdash;Oh! by the way,
Guillaume, I have been hearing about you. You seem to be
leading a merry sort of life.'</p>

<p>'I?' exclaimed the young man with a smile.</p>

<p>'Yes, you, my fine fellow! and observe that I get my
information from your father. He is much distressed about
it: he accuses you of gambling and of staying out all night
at the club and other places. Is it true that you have discovered
a low café behind the gaol where you go with a
company of scamps and play the devil's own game? I have
even been told&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Here Monsieur de Condamin, observing two ladies enter
the room, began to whisper in Guillaume's ear, while the
young man replied with affirmative signs and shook with
suppressed laughter. Then he bent forward in turn and whispered
to Monsieur de Condamin, and the pair of them, drawing
close together with brightly glistening eyes, seemed to
derive a prolonged enjoyment from this private story, which
could not be told in the presence of ladies.</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas had remained where he was. He no longer
listened to what was being said, but watched the many movements
of Monsieur Delangre, who bustled about the green
drawing-room trying to make himself extremely agreeable.
The priest was so absorbed in his observations that he did not
see Abbé Bourrette beckoning to him, so that the other
had to come and touch his shoulder and ask him to follow.
He then led him into the card-room with all the precaution
of a man who has some very delicate communication to
make.</p>

<p>'My dear friend,' he whispered, when they were alone in
a quiet corner, 'it is excusable in you, as this is the first time
you have been here, but I must warn you that you have compromised
yourself very considerably by talking so long with
the persons you have just left.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, as Abbé Faujas looked at him with great surprise,
he added:</p>

<p>'Those persons are not looked upon favourably. I myself
am not passing any judgment upon them, and I don't want
to repeat any scandal. I am simply warning you out of pure
friendship, that's all.'</p>

<p>He was going away, but Abbé Faujas detained him, exclaiming
hastily:</p>

<p>'You disquiet me, my dear Monsieur Bourrette; I beg of
you to explain yourself. Without speaking any ill of anyone,
you can surely be a little clearer.'</p>

<p>'Well then,' replied the old priest, after a momentary
hesitation, 'Doctor Porquier's son causes his worthy father
the greatest distress, and sets the worst example to all the
studious youth of Plassans. He left nothing but debts behind
him in Paris, and here he is turning the whole town upside
down. As for Monsieur de Condamin&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Here he hesitated again, feeling embarrassed by the
enormity of what he had to relate; then, lowering his eyes,
he resumed:</p>

<p>'Monsieur de Condamin is very free in his conversation,
and I fear that he is deficient in a sense of morality. He
spares no one, and he scandalises every honourable person.
Then&mdash;I really hardly know how to tell you&mdash;but he has contracted,
it is said, a scarcely creditable marriage. You see
that young woman there, who is not thirty years old, and
who has such a crowd around her? Well, he brought her to
Plassans one day from no one knows where. From the time
of her arrival she has been all-powerful here. It is she who
has got her husband and Doctor Porquier decorated. She
has influential friends in Paris. But I beg of you not to repeat
any of this. Madame de Condamin is very amiable and
charitable. I go to her house sometimes, and I should be
extremely distressed if I thought that she considered me an
enemy of hers. If she has committed faults, it is our duty&mdash;is
it not?&mdash;to help her to return to a better way of life.
As for her husband, he is, between ourselves, a perfect scamp.
Have as little as possible to do with him.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas gazed into the worthy Bourrette's eyes. He
had just noticed that Madame Rougon was following their
conversation from the distance with a thoughtful air.</p>

<p>'Wasn't it Madame Rougon who told you to come and
give me this good advice?' he suddenly asked the old priest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>'How did you know that?' the latter exclaimed in great
astonishment. 'She asked me not to mention her name, but
since you have guessed it&mdash;Ah! she is a good, kind-hearted
lady who would be much distressed to see a priest compromising
himself in her house. She is unfortunately compelled to
receive all sorts of persons.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas expressed his thanks, and promised to be
more prudent in the future. The card-players had not taken
any notice of the two priests, who returned into the big
drawing-room, where Faujas was again conscious of hostile
surroundings. He even experienced greater coldness and
more silent contempt than before. The ladies pulled their
dresses out of his way as though his touch would have soiled
them, and the men turned away from him with sneering
titters. He himself maintained haughty calmness and indifference.
Fancying that he heard the word Besançon
meaningly pronounced in a corner of the room where Madame
de Condamin was holding her court, he walked straight up to
the folks by whom she was surrounded; but, at his approach,
there was a dead silence amongst them, and they all stared
him in the face with eyes that gleamed with uncharitable
curiosity. He felt quite sure that they had been talking about
him, and repeating some disgraceful story. While he was still
standing there, behind the Rastoil young ladies, who had not
observed him, he heard the younger one ask her sister:</p>

<p>'What was it that this priest, of whom everyone is talking,
did at Besançon?'</p>

<p>'I don't quite know,' the elder sister replied. 'I believe
he nearly murdered his vicar in a quarrel they had. Papa
also said that he had been mixed up in some great business
speculation which turned out badly.'</p>

<p>'He's in the small room over there, isn't he? Somebody
saw him just now laughing with Monsieur de Condamin.'</p>

<p>'Oh! then people do quite right to distrust him if he
laughs with Monsieur de Condamin.'</p>

<p>This gossip of the two girls made perspiration start from
Abbé Faujas's brows. He did not frown, but his lips tightened
one upon the other, and his cheeks took an ashy tint. He
seemed to hear the whole room talking of the priest whom he
had tried to murder, and of the shady transactions in which
he had been concerned.</p>

<p>Opposite him were Monsieur Delangre and Doctor Porquier,
still looking very severe; Monsieur de Bourdeu's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
mouth pouted scornfully as he said something in a low voice
to a lady; Monsieur Maffre, the justice of the peace, was
casting furtive glances at him, as if he had piously resolved
to examine him from a distance before condemning him; and
at the other end of the room the two hideous Paloques craned
out their malice-warped faces, in which shone a wicked joy at
all the cruel stories that were being whispered about. Abbé
Faujas slowly retired as he saw Madame Rastoil, who had
been standing a few paces away, come up and seat herself
between her two daughters, as though to keep them under the
protection of her wing and shield them from his touch. He
rested his elbow on the piano which he saw behind him, and
there he stood with his head erect and his face as hard and
silent as a face of stone. He felt that they were all in a plot
to treat him as an outcast.</p>

<p>As he stood thus gazing at the company from under his
partially lowered eyelids he suddenly gave a slight start,
which he quickly suppressed. He had just caught sight of
Abbé Fenil, leaning back in an easy-chair and smiling quietly
behind a perfect wall of petticoats. The eyes of the two men
met, and they gazed at each other for some moments with
the fierce expression of duellists about to engage in mortal
combat. Then there was a rustling of silk, and Abbé Fenil
was hidden from sight by the ladies' gowns.</p>

<p>However, Félicité had contrived to reach the neighbourhood
of the piano, and when she had succeeded in installing
at it the elder of the Rastoil girls, who had a pleasant voice,
and was able to speak to Abbé Faujas without being heard,
she drew him towards one of the windows and asked:</p>

<p>'What have you done to Abbé Fenil?'</p>

<p>They talked together in very low tones. The priest at
first feigned surprise, but when Madame Rougon had murmured
a few words, accompanied by sundry shruggings of
her shoulders, he seemed to become more open with her.
They both smiled, and made a pretence of merely exchanging
ordinary courtesies, but the glistening of their eyes spoke of
something much more serious. The piano was silent for
a moment, and then the elder Mademoiselle Rastoil began to
sing 'La Colombe du Soldat,' which was a favourite song at
that time.</p>

<p>'Your <i>début</i> has been most unfortunate,' Félicité continued.
'You have quite set people against you, and I should
advise you not to come here again for a considerable time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
You must make yourself popular and a favourite, you understand.
Any rash act would be fatal.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas seemed absorbed in thought.</p>

<p>'You say that it was Abbé Fenil who circulated these
abominable stories?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Oh, he is much too wily to commit himself in such a
way. He must just have faintly suggested them to his
penitents. I don't know whether he has found you out, but
he is certainly afraid of you. I am sure of that. And he will
attack you in every possible way. The most unfortunate part
of the matter is that he confesses the most important people
in the town. It was he who secured the election of the
Marquis de Lagrifoul.'</p>

<p>'I did wrong to come this evening,' the priest murmured.</p>

<p>Félicité bit her lips, then continued with animation:</p>

<p>'You did wrong to compromise yourself with such a man
as that Condamin. I did what I thought was best. When
the person whom you know of wrote to me from Paris I
thought that I should be doing you a service by inviting you
here. I imagined that you would be able to make it an
opportunity for gaining friends. But, instead of doing what
you could to make yourself popular, you have set everyone
against you. Please excuse my freedom, but you really seem
to be doing all you can to ensure your failure. You have
committed nothing but mistakes: in going to lodge with my
son-in-law, in persistently keeping yourself aloof from others,
and in walking about in a cassock which makes the street-lads
jeer at you.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas could not repress a movement of impatience.
However, he merely replied:</p>

<p>'I will profit by your kind advice. Only, don't try to
assist me; that would mar everything.'</p>

<p>'Yes, what you say is prudent,' replied the old lady.
'Only return here in triumph. One last word, my dear sir.
The person in Paris is most anxious for your success, and it
is for that reason that I am interesting myself in you. Well,
then, don't make people frightened of you&mdash;shun you; be
pleasant, and make yourself agreeable to the ladies. Remember
that particularly. You must make yourself agreeable
to the ladies if you want to get Plassans on your side.'</p>

<p>The elder Mademoiselle Rastoil had just finished her song
with a final flourish, and the guests were softly applauding
her. Madame Rougon left the Abbé to go and congratulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the singer. Then she took up a position in the middle of the
room, and shook hands with the visitors who were beginning
to retire. It was eleven o'clock. The Abbé was much vexed
to find that the worthy Bourrette had taken advantage of the
music to effect his escape. He had thought of leaving with
him&mdash;a course which would have enabled him to make a
respectable exit. Now, however, he would have to go away
alone, which would be extremely prejudicial to him. It would
be reported through the town in the morning that he had
been turned out of the house. So he retired into a window-recess,
whence he watched for an opportunity to effect an
honourable retreat.</p>

<p>The room was emptying fast, however, and there were
only a few ladies left. At last he noticed one who was very
simply dressed; it was Madame Mouret, whose slightly waved
hair made her look younger than usual. He looked with
surprise at her tranquil face and her large, peaceful black
eyes. He had not noticed her during the evening; she had
quietly remained in the same corner without moving, vexed
at wasting her time in this way, with her hands in her lap,
doing nothing. While he was looking at her she rose to take
leave of her mother.</p>

<p>It was one of Félicité's greatest delights to see the high
society of Plassans leave her with profuse bows and thanks
for her punch, her green drawing-room, and the pleasant
evening they had spent there; and she thought how, formerly,
these same fine folks had trampled her underfoot, whereas
now the richest amongst them could not find sweet enough
smiles for 'dear Madame Rougon.'</p>

<p>'Ah, madame!' murmured Maffre, the justice of the peace,
'one quite forgets the passage of time here.'</p>

<p>'You are the only pleasant hostess in all this uncivilised
place,' whispered pretty Madame de Condamin.</p>

<p>'We shall expect you to dinner to-morrow,' said Monsieur
Delangre; 'but you must take pot-luck, for we don't pretend
to do as you do.'</p>

<p>Marthe was obliged to make her way through all this
incense-offering crowd in order to reach her mother. She
kissed her, and was about to retire, when Félicité detained
her and looked around as if to trying to find someone. Then
on catching sight of Abbé Faujas, she inquired, with a smile:</p>

<p>'Is your reverence a gallant man?'</p>

<p>The Abbé bowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>'Well, then, I should be much obliged to you if you
would escort my daughter home. You both live in the same
house, and so it will not put you to any inconvenience. On
the road there is a little bit of dark lane which is not very
pleasant for a lady by herself.'</p>

<p>Marthe assured her mother, in her quiet way, that she
was not a little girl, and in no wise felt afraid; but as Félicité
insisted, saying that she should feel easier if her daughter had
someone with her, she at last accepted the Abbé's escort. As
the latter retired with her, Félicité, who accompanied them to
the landing, whispered in the priest's ear, with a smile:</p>

<p>'Don't forget what I told you. You must make yourself
agreeable to the ladies if you want Plassans to belong
to you.'</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="VII" id="VII">VII</a></h3>


<p>That same night Mouret, who was still awake when his wife
returned home, plied her with questions in his desire to find
out what had taken place at Madame Rougon's. She told him
that everything had gone off as usual, and that she had
noticed nothing out of the common. She just added that
Abbé Faujas had walked home with her, but had merely
spoken of commonplace matters. Mouret was very much
vexed at what he called his wife's indolence.</p>

<p>'If anyone had committed suicide at your mother's,' he
growled, as he angrily buried his head in his pillow, 'you
would know nothing about it!'</p>

<p>When he came home to dinner the next day, he called to
Marthe as soon as he caught sight of her:</p>

<p>'I was sure of it! I knew you had never troubled yourself
to use your eyes! It's just like you! Sitting the whole
evening in a room and never having the faintest notion of
what was being said or done around you! Why, the whole
town is talking about it! The whole town, do you hear? I
couldn't go anywhere without somebody speaking to me about&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'About what, my dear?' asked Marthe, in astonishment.</p>

<p>'About the fine success of Abbé Faujas, forsooth! He was
turned out of the green drawing-room!'</p>

<p>'Indeed he wasn't! I saw nothing of the kind.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>'Haven't I told you that you never see anything? Do
you know what the Abbé did at Besançon? He either
murdered a priest or committed forgery! They are not quite
certain which it was. However, they seem to have given him
a nice reception! He turned quite green. Well, it's all up
with him now!'</p>

<p>Marthe bent her head and allowed her husband to revel in
the priest's discomfiture. Mouret was delighted.</p>

<p>'I still stick to my first idea,' he said; 'your mother and
he have got some underhand plot together. I hear that she
showed him the greatest civility. It was she, wasn't it, who
asked him to accompany you home? Why didn't you tell
me so?'</p>

<p>Marthe shrugged her shoulders without replying.</p>

<p>'You are the most provoking woman in the world!' her
husband cried. 'All these little details are of the greatest
importance. Madame Paloque, whom I have just met, told me
that she and several other ladies had lingered behind to see
how the Abbé would effect his departure, and that your
mother availed herself of you to cover the parson's retreat.
Just try to remember, now, what he said to you as he walked
home with you.'</p>

<p>He sat down by his wife's side with his keen, questioning
little eyes fixed upon her.</p>

<p>'Really,' said she quietly, 'he only talked to me about the
trifling commonplace matters such as anyone might have
talked of. He spoke about the cold, which was very sharp,
and about the quietness of the town at night-time, and I
think he mentioned the pleasant evening he had passed.'</p>

<p>'Ah, the hypocrite! Didn't he ask you any questions
about your mother or her guests?'</p>

<p>'No. The Rue de la Banne is only a very short distance,
you know, and it didn't take us three minutes. He walked
by my side without offering me his arm, and he took such
long strides that I was almost obliged to run. I don't know
why folks should all be so bitter against him. He doesn't
seem very well off, and he was shivering, poor man, in that
threadbare old cassock of his.'</p>

<p>Mouret was not without pity and sympathy.</p>

<p>'Ah! he must have done,' he said; 'he can't feel very
warm now that the frost has come.'</p>

<p>'I'm sure we have nothing to complain of in his conduct,'
Marthe continued. 'He is very punctual in his payments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
and he makes no noise and gives no trouble. Where could
you find a more desirable tenant?'</p>

<p>'Nowhere, I grant you. What I was saying just now was
to show you what little attention you pay, wherever you go,
to what takes place around you. I know the set your mother
receives too well to attach much weight to anything that
happens in the green drawing-room: it's a perpetual source
of lies and the most ridiculous stories. I don't suppose for a
moment that the Abbé ever murdered anyone any more than
that he was ever a bankrupt; and I told Madame Paloque
that people ought to see that their own linen was clean before
they found fault with that of others. I hope she took the
hint to herself.'</p>

<p>This was a fib on Mouret's part, for he had said nothing
of the kind to Madame Paloque; but Marthe's pity had made
him feel rather ashamed of the delight which he had manifested
at the Abbé's troubles. On the following days he went
entirely over to the priest's side, and whenever he happened
to meet any people whom he detested, Monsieur de Bourdeu,
Monsieur Delangre, and Doctor Porquier, he launched out
into warm praises of the Abbé just for the pleasure of
astonishing and annoying them. The Abbé, said he, was a
man of great courage and perfect guilelessness, but extremely
poor, and some very base-minded person must have originated
the calumnies about him. Then he went on to have a rap at
the Rougons' guests, whom he called hypocrites, canting
humbugs and stuck-up idiots, who were afraid of a man of
real virtue. In a short time he had quite made the Abbé's
quarrel his own, and availed himself of it to attack both the
Rastoil gang and the gang of the Sub-Prefecture as well.</p>

<p>'Isn't it pitiable?' he sometimes said to his wife, forgetting
that she had heard him tell a very different story, 'isn't
it pitiable to see a lot of people who stole their money no one
knows where, leaguing so bitterly against a poor man just
because he hasn't got twenty francs to spare to buy a cart-load
of firewood? Such conduct quite disgusts me! I'm quite
willing to be surety for him. I ought to know what he does
and what sort of a man he is, since he lives in my house; and
so I'm not slack in telling them the truth, I give them all
they deserve when I meet them. And I won't content myself
with that, either. I want the Abbé to be my friend, and I
mean to walk out with him arm-in-arm along the promenade
to let people know that I'm not afraid of being seen with him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
rich and well thought of as I am! I hope, too, that you will
show all the kindness and consideration to these poor people
that you can.'</p>

<p>Marthe smiled quietly. She was delighted at the friendly
disposition her husband was now manifesting towards their
lodgers. Rose was ordered to show them every civility; she
was even told that she might volunteer to do Madame Faujas'
shopping for her on wet mornings. The latter, however, always
declined the cook's services, though she no longer manifested
that silent stiffness of demeanour which she had shown
during the earlier days of her residence in the house. One
morning, as she met Marthe, who was coming down from an
attic which was used as a store-room for the fruit, she stopped
and talked to her for a moment, and even unbent so far as to
accept a couple of magnificent pears. Those pears were the
beginning of a closer intimacy between them.</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas, too, did not now glide so hurriedly up and
down the stairs as he had been wont to do. Almost every
day, when Mouret heard the rustling of the priest's cassock as
he came down, he hastened to the foot of the staircase and
told the Abbé that it would give him great pleasure to walk
part of the way with him. He had also thanked him for the
little service he had done his wife, skilfully questioning him
at the time to find out if he intended again calling on the
Rougons. The Abbé had smiled and freely confessed that he
was not fitted for society. This had delighted Mouret, who
felt quite certain that he had had some influence in bringing
about his lodger's decision. He even began to dream of preventing
all future intercourse with the green drawing-room and
of keeping him altogether to himself. So, when Marthe told
him one evening that Madame Faujas had accepted a couple
of pears, he looked upon this as a fortunate circumstance
which would facilitate the execution of his designs.</p>

<p>'Haven't they really got a fire on the second floor this
bitterly cold weather?' he asked, in Rose's presence.</p>

<p>'No, indeed, sir,' replied the cook, who understood that
the question was meant for herself; 'they couldn't very well
have one, for I've never seen the least bit of wood taken
upstairs, unless indeed they're burning their four chairs or
Madame Faujas manages to carry up the wood in her basket.'</p>

<p>'It is not right of you to talk in that way, Rose,' said
Marthe. 'The poor things must be shivering with cold in
those big rooms.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>'I should think so, indeed,' exclaimed Mouret; 'there
were several degrees of frost last night and there was considerable
fear felt about the olive-trees. The water in our jug
upstairs was frozen. This room of ours here is a small one,
however, and very warm.'</p>

<p>The doors and windows of the dining-room were provided
with pads, so that no draught could find its way through any
crevice, and a big earthenware stove made the place as warm
as a bakehouse. During the winter evenings the young
people read or played round the table, while Mouret made his
wife play piquet till bed-time, which, by the way, was perfect
torture to her. For a long time she had refused to touch the
cards, saying that she did not know a single game, but at last
he had taught her piquet, and she had then been forced to
resign herself to her fate.</p>

<p>'Don't you think,' Mouret continued, 'that we really
ought to ask the Faujases to come and spend the evenings
here? They would at any rate be warm for two or three
hours; and they would be company for us, too, and make us
feel more lively. Ask them, and I don't think they'll refuse.'</p>

<p>The next day Marthe met Madame Faujas in the hall
and gave the invitation, which the old lady at once accepted,
both for herself and her son.</p>

<p>'I'm surprised she didn't make some little demur about
coming,' said Mouret. 'I fancied that they would have
required more pressing. But the Abbé is beginning to
understand that he does wrong in living like a wild beast.'</p>

<p>In the evening Mouret took care that the table was cleared
in good time, and he set out a bottle of sweet wine and a
plateful of little cakes. Although he was not given to being
lavish, he was anxious to show that the Rougons were not
the only people who knew how things ought to be done.
The tenants of the second floor came downstairs about eight
o'clock. Abbé Faujas was wearing a new cassock, at the
sight of which Mouret was so much surprised that he could
only stammer a few words in answer to the priest's courtesies.</p>

<p>'Indeed, Monsieur l'Abbé, all the honour is for us. Come,
children, put some chairs here.'</p>

<p>They all took their seats round the table. The room was
uncomfortably warm, for Mouret had crammed the stove as
full as possible in order to let his guests see that he made no
account of a log more or less. Abbé Faujas made himself
very pleasant, fondling Désirée and questioning the two lads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
about their studies. Marthe, who was knitting some stockings,
raised her eyes every now and then in surprise at the flexible
tones of that strange voice which she was not accustomed to
hear sounding in the monotonous quietness of the dining-room.
She looked at the priest's powerful face and square-cut
features, and then bent her head again, without trying to
hide the interest she took in this man who was so strong and
kindly and whom she knew to be so poor. As for Mouret, he
uncouthly stared at the new cassock, and could not restrain
himself from saying, with a sly smile:</p>

<p>'You needn't have troubled to dress to come here,
Monsieur l'Abbé. We don't go in for ceremony, as you know
very well.'</p>

<p>Marthe blushed, while the priest gaily related that he had
bought the cassock that very day. He had kept it on, he
said, to please his mother, who thought that he looked finer
than a king in it.</p>

<p>'Don't you, mother?' he asked the old lady.</p>

<p>Madame Faujas nodded without taking her eyes off her
son. She was sitting opposite to him, gazing at him in the
bright lamplight with an air of ecstasy.</p>

<p>They began to talk of various matters, and Abbé Faujas
seemed to throw off his gloomy coldness. He still remained
grave, but it was with a pleasant, good-natured gravity. He
listened attentively to Mouret, replied to his most insignificant
remarks, and seemed to take an interest in his gossip. His
landlord explained to him the manner in which the family
lived, and finished his account by saying:</p>

<p>'We spend our evenings in the way you see, always as
quietly as this. We never invite anyone, as we are always
more comfortable by ourselves. Every evening I have a
game at piquet with my wife. It is a very old habit of ours,
and I could scarcely go to sleep without it.'</p>

<p>'Pray don't let us interfere with it!' cried Abbé Faujas.
'I beg that you won't in any way depart from your usual
habits on our account.'</p>

<p>'Oh dear no! I am not a monomaniac about it, and it
won't kill me to go without it for once.'</p>

<p>The priest insisted for a time, but, when he saw that
Marthe declined to play with even greater determination than
her husband, he turned towards his mother, who had been
sitting silent with her hands folded in front of her, and said:</p>

<p>'Mother, you have a game with Monsieur Mouret.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked keenly into her son's eyes, while Mouret still
continued to refuse, and declared that he did not want to
break up the party. However, when the priest told him that
his mother was a good player he gave way.</p>

<p>'Is she, indeed?' he said. 'Then, if madame really
wishes it, and no one objects&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Come along, mother, and have a game!' said Abbé
Faujas in a more decided tone.</p>

<p>'Certainly,' she replied, 'I shall be delighted; but I shall
have to change my place.'</p>

<p>'Oh! there will be no difficulty about that,' said Mouret,
who was quite charmed. 'You had better take your son's
seat, and perhaps Monsieur l'Abbé will be good enough to
sit next to my wife. Madame can sit next to me. There!
that will do capitally.'</p>

<p>The priest, who had at first been opposite to Marthe on
the other side of the table, was thus placed next to her.
They sat quite apart by themselves, the two players having
drawn their chairs close together to engage in their struggle.
Octave and Serge had just gone up to their room. Désirée
was sleeping with her head on the table after her usual
custom. When ten o'clock struck, Mouret, who had lost the
first game, did not feel inclined to go to bed but asked for his
revenge. Madame Faujas consulted her son with a glance,
and then in her tranquil fashion began to shuffle the cards.
The Abbé had merely exchanged a few words with Marthe.
On this the first evening that he spent in the dining-room
he only spoke of commonplace topics; the household, the
price of victuals at Plassans, and the anxieties which children
caused. Marthe replied with a show of interest, looking up
every now and then with her bright glance, and importing
into the conversation some of her own sedate good sense.</p>

<p>It was nearly eleven o'clock when Mouret threw down
the cards with some slight irritation.</p>

<p>'I have lost again!' he said. 'I haven't had a single
good card all the evening. Perhaps I shall have better luck
to-morrow. We shall see you again, I hope, madame?'</p>

<p>And when Abbé Faujas began to protest that they could
not think of abusing the Mourets' kindness by disturbing
them in this way every evening, he continued:</p>

<p>'But you are not disturbing us at all, you are giving us
pleasure. Besides, I have been defeated, and I'm sure that
madame can't refuse me another game.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>When the priest and his mother had accepted the invitation
and had gone upstairs again, Mouret showed some ill-temper
and began to excuse himself for having lost. He seemed
quite annoyed about it.</p>

<p>'The old woman isn't as good a player as I am, I'm sure,'
he said to his wife; 'but she has got such eyes! I could
really almost fancy she was cheating, upon my word I could!
Well! we shall see what happens to-morrow.'</p>

<p>From that time the Faujases came down regularly every
day to spend the evening with the Mourets. There were
tremendous battles between the old lady and her landlord.
She seemed to play with him, to let him win just frequently
enough to prevent him from being altogether discouraged, and
this made him fume with suppressed anger, for he prided
himself on his skill at piquet. He used to indulge in dreams
of beating her night after night for weeks in succession
without ever letting her win a single game; while she ever
preserved wonderful coolness, her square peasant-like face
remaining quite expressionless as with her big hands she
threw down the cards with all the regularity of a machine.
From eight o'clock till bed-time they would remain seated at
their end of the table, quite absorbed in their game and never
moving.</p>

<p>At the other end, near the stove, Abbé Faujas and Marthe
were left entirely to themselves. The Abbé felt a masculine
and priestly disdain for woman, and in spite of himself this
disdain often made itself manifest in some slightly harsh
expression. On these occasions Marthe was affected by a
strange feeling of anxiety. She raised her eyes with one of
those sudden thrills of alarm which cause people to cast a
hurried glance behind them, half expecting to see some
concealed enemy raising his hand to strike. At other times,
on catching sight of the Abbé's cassock, she would check
herself suddenly in the midst of a laugh, and would relapse
into silence, quite confused, astonished at finding herself
talking so freely to a man who was so different from other
men. It was a long time before there was any real intimacy
between them.</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas never directly questioned Marthe about her
husband, or her children, or her house; but, nevertheless, he
gradually made himself acquainted with every detail of their
history and manner of life. Every evening, while Mouret
and Madame Faujas were contending furiously one against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the other, he contrived to learn some new fact. Upon one
occasion he remarked that the husband and wife were
surprisingly alike.</p>

<p>'Yes,' Marthe answered with a smile, 'when we were
twenty years old we used to be taken for brother and sister;
and, indeed, it was a little owing to that circumstance that
we got married. People used to joke us about it, and were
continually making us stand side by side, and saying what a
fine couple we should make. The likeness was so striking
that worthy Monsieur Compan, though he knew us quite
well, hesitated to marry us.'</p>

<p>'But you are cousins, are you not?' the priest asked.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she replied, with a slight blush, 'my husband is a
Macquart, and I am a Rougon.'</p>

<p>Then she kept silence for a moment or two, feeling ill at
ease, for she was sure that the priest knew the history of her
family which was so notorious at Plassans. The Macquarts
were an illegitimate branch of the Rougons.</p>

<p>'The most singular part of it,' she resumed, to conceal
her embarrassment, 'is, that we both resemble our grandmother.
My husband's mother transmitted the likeness to
him, while in me it has sprung up again after a break,
passing my father by.'</p>

<p>Then the Abbé cited a similar instance in his own family.
He had a sister, he said, who was the living image of her
mother's grandfather. The likeness in this case had leapt
over two generations. His sister, too, closely resembled the
old man in her character and habits, even in her gestures and
the tone of her voice.</p>

<p>'It was just the same with me when I was a little girl; I
often heard people say of me,' remarked Marthe, '"She's Aunt
Dide all over again!" The poor woman is now at Les
Tulettes. She never had a strong head. For my part, in
growing older, I have become less excitable and stronger, but
I remember that when I was a child I hadn't good health at
all. I used to have attacks of giddiness, and my head was
filled with the strangest fancies. I often laugh now when I
think of the extraordinary things I used to do.'</p>

<p>'And your husband?'</p>

<p>'Oh! he takes after his father, a journeyman hatter, a
careful, prudent man. I should say that when we were young,
though we were so much alike in face, it was quite a different
matter as to our dispositions; however, as time has gone on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
we have grown to resemble each other very much. We were
so quiet and happy in our business at Marseilles! The fifteen
years I spent there taught me to find happiness in my own
home, in the midst of my children.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas noticed a touch of bitterness in her tone
every time that he led her to speak on this subject. She was
certainly happy, as she said; but he fancied that he could
detect traces of old rebellion in her nervous nature, that was
now calmed by the approach of her fortieth year. He
imagined a little drama for himself, in which this husband
and wife, who were so much alike, were considered by their
relations to be made for each other, and were thus forced into
marriage, whereas, in reality, they were of different and
antagonistic temperaments. Then his mind dwelt upon the
fatal outcome of a monotonous life, the wearing away of
character by the daily cares of business, the soporific effect of
fifteen years' fortune-making upon this couple, who were now
living upon that fortune in a sleepy corner of a little town.
To-day, though they were both still young, there seemed to
be nothing but the ashes left of their former selves. The
Abbé cleverly tried to discover whether Marthe was resigned
to her existence, and he found her full of common sense.</p>

<p>'I am quite contented with my home,' she said; 'my
children are all that I want. I was never much given to
gaiety; I only felt a little dull at times. I dare say I should
have been better if I had had some mental occupation, but I
was never able to find one. And perhaps, after all, it's as
well I didn't, for I should very likely have split my head. I
could never even read a novel without giving myself a
frightful headache, and for nights afterwards all the characters
would dance about in my brain. Needlework is the only
thing which never fatigues me, so I stay at home and keep
out of the way of noise and chatter, and all the frivolous follies
which weary me.'</p>

<p>She paused every now and then to glance at Désirée, who
was still sleeping with her head upon the table, and smiling
in her innocent way.</p>

<p>'Poor child!' she murmured. 'She can't even do any
needlework. She gets dizzy directly. She is fond of animals,
and that's all she's capable of. When she goes to stay with
her nurse, as she does every now and then, she spends all her
time in the poultry-yard, and she comes back to me with rosy
cheeks and as strong and well as possible.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>Marthe often spoke of Les Tulettes, manifesting as she did
so a lurking fear of insanity, and Abbé Faujas thus became
aware of a strange dread haunting this peaceful home.
Marthe loved her husband with a sober, unimpassioned love,
but there was mingled with her affection for him considerable
fear of his jokes and pleasantries, his perpetual teasing. She
was hurt, too, by his selfishness, and the loneliness in which
he left her; she felt a vague grudge against him for the
quietude in which she lived&mdash;that very manner of life which
she said made her happy. When she spoke of him, she said:</p>

<p>'He is very good to us. You've heard him, I dare say,
get angry sometimes, but that arises from his passion for
seeing everything in order, which he often carries to an almost
ridiculous extent. He gets quite vexed if he sees a flower-pot
a little out of place in the garden, or a plaything lying
about on the floor; but in other matters he does quite right
in pleasing himself. I know he is not very popular, because
he has managed to accumulate some money, and still continues
to do a good stroke of business every now and then; but he
only laughs at what people say about him. They say nasty
things, too, of him in connexion with me. They say that he
is a miser, and won't let me go out anywhere, and even
deprives me of boots. But all that is quite untrue. I am
entirely free. He certainly prefers to see me here when
he comes home, instead of finding that I am always off
somewhere, paying calls and walking on the promenade. But
he knows quite well what my tastes are. What, indeed,
should I go out for?'</p>

<p>As she defended Mouret against the gossip of Plassans,
Marthe's voice assumed a sudden animation, as though she
felt the need of defending him quite as much from the secret
accusations which arose within her own mind; and she kept
reverting with nervous uneasiness to the subject of society
life. She seemed to seek a refuge within the little dining-room
and the old-fashioned garden with its box borders, as if
everything else filled her with vague alarm, and made her
doubtful of her strength, apprehensive of some possible catastrophe.
Then she would smile at her fears, and shrug
her shoulders as she resumed her knitting or the mending of
some old skirt; and Abbé Faujas would see before him only
a cold, reserved housewife, with listless face and inanimate
eyes, who filled the house with a scent as of clean linen, and
of blossoms gathered in the shade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>Two months passed away in this manner. Abbé Faujas
and his mother had become quite a part of the Mourets'
family life. They all had their recognised places every
evening at the table, just as the lamp had its place; and the
same intervals of silence were broken night after night by the
same remarks from the card-players and the same subdued
converse of the priest and Marthe. When Madame Faujas
had not given him too tremendous a beating Mouret found
his lodgers 'extremely nice people.'</p>

<p>All that curiosity of his, born of idleness, waned before
the interest and occupation that the nightly parties afforded
him, and he no longer played the spy upon the Abbé, whom
he declared to be a very good fellow, now that he knew him
better.</p>

<p>'Oh, don't bother me with your stories!' he used to
exclaim to those who attacked Abbé Faujas. 'You get hold
of a pack of nonsense and put absurd interpretations upon
facts that admit of the simplest explanation. I know all
about him. He very kindly comes and spends his evenings
with us; but he's not a man to make himself cheap, and I
can quite understand that people don't like him for it and
accuse him of pride.'</p>

<p>Mouret greatly enjoyed being the only person in Plassans
who could boast of knowing Abbé Faujas, and he even somewhat
abused this advantage. Every time he met Madame
Rougon he put on an air of triumph and made her understand
that he had stolen her guest from her, while the old
lady contented herself with smiling quietly. With his intimate
acquaintances Mouret extended his confidences further, and
remarked that those blessed priests could do nothing like
other people. Then he gave them a string of little details,
and told them in what manner the Abbé drank, how he talked
to women, and how he always kept his knees apart without
ever crossing his legs, and other trifling matters which the
vague alarm that his free-thinking mind experienced in the
presence of his guest's long, mystic-looking cassock made
him notice.</p>

<p>The evenings passed away one after another, and at last
the first days of February came round. In all the conversations
between himself and Marthe Abbé Faujas had to all
appearance carefully avoided the subject of religion. She had
once remarked to him, almost lightly:</p>

<p>'No, Monsieur l'Abbé, I am not a very religious woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
and I seldom go to church. At Marseilles I was always too
busy, and now I am too indolent to go out. And then I
must confess to you that I wasn't brought up with religious
ideas. My mother used to tell me that God would come to
us quite as well at home.'</p>

<p>The priest bowed his head without making any reply, and
seemed to signify that he would rather not discuss religious
matters under such circumstances. One evening, however,
he drew a picture of the unexpected comfort which suffering
souls find in religion. They were talking of a poor woman
whom troubles of every sort had driven to suicide.</p>

<p>'She did wrong to despair,' said the priest in his deep
voice. 'She was ignorant of the comfort and consolation to
be found in prayer. I have often seen heart-broken, weeping
women come to us, and they have gone away again filled with
a resignation that they had vainly sought elsewhere, and glad
to live; and this had come from their falling upon their
knees and tasting the blessedness of humiliating themselves
before God in some quiet corner of the church. They came
back there, they forgot their troubles, and became God's
entirely.'</p>

<p>Marthe listened with a thoughtful expression to these
remarks of the priest, whose last words fell in a gradually
softening voice that seemed to breathe of superhuman
felicity.</p>

<p>'Yes, it must be a blessed thing,' she murmured, as
though she were speaking to herself. 'I have thought about
it sometimes, but I have always felt afraid.'</p>

<p>If the Abbé seldom referred to such matters as this, he
frequently spoke on the subject of charity. Marthe was very
tender-hearted, and tears rose to her eyes at the slightest
tale of trouble. It seemed to please the priest to see her so
moved to pity; and every evening he told her some fresh story
of sorrow, and kept her constantly excited with compassion.
She would let her work fall, and clasp her hands as, with a
sad, pitying face, she gazed into his eyes and listened to him
as he recounted heart-rending details of how some poor persons
had died of starvation, or how others had been goaded by
misery into committing base crimes. At these times she fell
completely under his influence, and he might have done what
he willed with her.</p>

<p>About the middle of February a deplorable occurrence
threw Plassans into dismay. It was discovered that a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of young girls, scarcely more than children, had fallen into
evil courses while loafing about the streets, and it was even
rumoured that some persons of high position in the town
would be compromised. For a week Marthe was very painfully
affected by this discovery, which caused the greatest
sensation. She was acquainted with one of the unfortunate
girls, who was the niece of her cook, Rose; and she could not
think of the poor little creature without shuddering.</p>

<p>'It is a great pity,' said Abbé Faujas to her one evening,
'that there isn't a Home at Plassans on the model of the one
at Besançon.'</p>

<p>Then, in reply to Marthe's pressing questions, the Abbé
explained to her the constitution of this Home. It was a sort
of refuge for girls from eight to fifteen years of age, the
daughters of working men, whose parents were obliged to
leave them alone during the day while they themselves went
to their employment. During the day-time these girls were
set to do needlework, and in the evening they were sent back
to their parents, the latter having then returned home from
their work. By this system the children were brought up out
of the reach of vice and in the midst of good examples.
Marthe thought the idea an admirable one, and she gradually
became so prepossessed in its favour that she could talk of
nothing else than the necessity of founding a similar institution
at Plassans.</p>

<p>'We might put it under the patronage of the Virgin,'
Abbé Faujas suggested. 'But there are such difficulties in
the way! You have no idea of the trouble there is in effecting
the least good work! What is quite essential to the success
of such a scheme as this is some woman with a motherly
heart, full of zeal and absolutely devoted to the work.'</p>

<p>Marthe lowered her head and looked at Désirée, who was
asleep by her side, and she felt tears welling from beneath
her eyelids. She made inquiries as to the steps that it would
be necessary to take for founding such a Home, the cost of
erecting it, and the annual expenses.</p>

<p>'Will you help me?' she suddenly asked the priest one
evening.</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas gravely took her hand and held it within
his own for a moment, telling her that she had one of the
fairest souls he had ever known. He would willingly do what
he could, he assured her, but he should rely altogether upon
her, for the assistance that he himself would be able to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
would be small. It would be for her to form a committee of
the ladies of the town, to collect subscriptions, and to take
upon herself, in a word, all the delicate and onerous duties
which are connected with an appeal to the charity of the
public. He appointed a meeting with her for the following
day at Saint-Saturnin's to introduce her to the diocesan
architect, who would be able to tell her much better than he
himself could do about the expenses that would have to be
incurred.</p>

<p>Mouret was very gay that evening when they went to bed.
He had not allowed Madame Faujas to win a single game.</p>

<p>'You seem quite pleased about something to-night, my
dear,' he said to his wife. 'Did you see what a beating I
gave the old lady downstairs?'</p>

<p>Then as he observed Marthe taking a silk dress out of her
wardrobe, he asked her with some surprise if she intended to
go out in the morning. He had not heard anything of the
conversation in the dining-room between his wife and the
priest.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she replied, 'I have to go out. I have to meet
Abbé Faujas at the church about a matter which I will tell
you of.'</p>

<p>He stood motionless in front of her, and gazed at her with
an expression of stupefaction, wondering if she were not
really jesting with him. Then, without any appearance of
displeasure, he said in his bantering fashion:</p>

<p>'Hallo! hallo! well I never expected that! So you've
gone over to the priests now!'</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="VIII" id="VIII">VIII</a></h3>


<p>The next morning Marthe began by calling on her mother,
to whom she explained the pious undertaking which she
was contemplating. She became almost angry when the old
lady smilingly shook her head, and she gave her to understand
that she considered her lacking in charity.</p>

<p>'It is one of Abbé Faujas's ideas, isn't it?' Félicité
suddenly inquired.</p>

<p>'Yes,' Marthe replied in surprise: 'we have talked a good
deal about it together. But how did you know?'</p>

<p>Madame Rougon shrugged her shoulders without vouchsafing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
any definite reply. Then she continued with a show
of animation:</p>

<p>'Well, my dear, I think you are quite right. You ought
to have some kind of occupation, and you have found a very
good one. It has always distressed me very much to see you
perpetually shut up in that lonely, death-like house of yours.
But you mustn't count upon my assistance. I would rather
not appear in the matter, for people would say that it was I
who was really doing everything, and that we had come to an
understanding together to try to force our ideas upon the
town. I should prefer that you yourself should have all the
credit of your charitable inspiration. I will help you with my
advice, if you will let me, but with nothing more.'</p>

<p>'I was hoping that you would join the committee,' said
Marthe, who felt a little alarmed at the thought of finding
herself alone in such an onerous undertaking.</p>

<p>'No! no! my presence on it would only do harm, I can
assure you. Make it well known, on the contrary, that I am
not going to be on the committee, that I have been asked,
and have refused, excusing myself on the ground that I am
too much occupied. Let it be understood, even, that I have
no faith in your scheme; and that, you will see, will influence
the ladies at once. They will be delighted to take part in
charitable work in which I have no share. Go and see
Madame Rastoil, Madame de Condamin, Madame Delangre,
and Madame Paloque. Be sure to see Madame Paloque; she
will feel flattered, and will help you more than all the others.
If you find any difficulty about anything, come here again and
tell me.'</p>

<p>She accompanied her daughter to the head of the stairs;
then she stopped and looked her in the face, saying with her
sharp smile:</p>

<p>'I hope the dear Abbé keeps well.'</p>

<p>'Yes, he is quite well,' replied Marthe. 'I am going to
Saint-Saturnin's, where I am to meet the diocesan architect.'</p>

<p>Marthe and the priest had considered that matters were
still in too indefinite a stage for them to disturb the architect,
and so they had planned just to meet him at Saint-Saturnin's,
where he came every day to inspect a chapel that happened
to be under repair at the time. It would seem like a chance
meeting. When Marthe walked up the church, she caught
sight of Abbé Faujas and Monsieur Lieutaud&mdash;the architect&mdash;talking
together on some scaffolding, from which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
descended as soon as they saw her. One of the Abbé's
shoulders was quite white with plaster, and he seemed to be
taking a great interest in the operations.</p>

<p>At this hour of the afternoon, there were no worshippers
or penitents in the church, and the nave and aisles were quite
deserted, encumbered only by a litter of chairs, which two
vergers were noisily setting in order. Workmen were calling
to each other from the tops of ladders, and trowels were
scraping against the walls. There was so little appearance of
devotion about Saint-Saturnin's that Marthe had not even
crossed herself on entering. She took a seat opposite to the
chapel that was being repaired, between Abbé Faujas and
Monsieur Lieutaud, just as she would have done if she had
gone to consult the latter in his office.</p>

<p>The conversation lasted for a good half-hour. The architect
showed much kindly interest in the scheme. But he
advised them not to erect a special building for the Home of
the Virgin, as the Abbé called the projected refuge. It would
cost too much money, he thought; and it would be better to
buy some building already in existence, and adapt it to suit
the requirements of their scheme. He suggested a house in
the Faubourg which, after being used as a boarding-school,
had passed into the hands of a forage dealer, and was now for
sale. A few thousand francs would enable one to entirely
transform the place and restore it from its present ruinous
condition; and he promised them all kinds of wonderful
things: a handsome entrance, spacious rooms, and a court
planted with trees. By degrees, Marthe and the priest raised
their voices, and they discussed details beneath the echoing
vaults of the nave, while Monsieur Lieutaud scratched the
flag-stones with the tip of his stick to give them an idea of the
façade he suggested.</p>

<p>'It is settled, then,' said Marthe, as she took leave of the
architect. 'You will make a little estimate, won't you, so
that we may know what we are about? And please keep our
secret, will you?'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas wished to escort her as far as the door of
the church. As they passed together before the high-altar,
however, while she was still briskly talking to him, she was
suddenly surprised to miss him from her side. She turned
round and saw him bent almost double before the great cross,
veiled with muslin. The sight of him, covered as he was
with plaster, bent in this way before the cross, gave her a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
singular feeling. She recollected where she was, glanced
round her with an uneasy expression and trod as silently
as she could. When they reached the door, the Abbé, who
had become very grave and serious, silently reached out
his finger, which he had dipped in the holy water, and she
crossed herself in great disquietude of mind. Then the
muffled doors softly fell back behind her with a sound like
a sigh.</p>

<p>From the church Marthe repaired to Madame de Condamin's.
She felt quite happy as she walked through the
streets in the fresh air; the few visits that she had now to
make seemed to her almost like pleasure-parties. Madame de
Condamin welcomed her with an air of friendly surprise.
That dear Madame Mouret came so seldom! When she
learned the business on hand, she declared herself charmed
with it, and was quite ready to further it in every possible
way. She was wearing a lovely mauve dress, with knots of
pearl-grey ribbon, in that pretty boudoir of hers where she
played the part of an exiled Parisienne.</p>

<p>'You did quite right to count upon me,' she exclaimed
as she pressed Marthe's hands. 'Who ought to help those
poor girls if it isn't we whom people accuse of setting them a
bad example by our luxury? It is frightful to think of those
children being exposed to all those horrible dangers. It has
made me feel quite ill. I am entirely at your service.'</p>

<p>When Marthe told her that her mother could not join
the committee she displayed still greater enthusiasm for the
scheme.</p>

<p>'It is a pity Madame Rougon has so many things to do,'
she said with a touch of irony; 'she would have been of great
assistance to us. But it can't be helped. No one can do
more than they are able. I have plenty of friends. I will go
and see the Bishop; and move heaven and earth if it's necessary.
I'll promise you that we shall succeed.'</p>

<p>She would not listen to any of the particulars about the
expenses. She was quite sure, she said, that whatever money
was wanted would be found, and she meant the Home to be a
credit to the committee, as handsome and as comfortable as
possible. She added with a laugh that she quite lost her
head when she began to dabble in figures; but she undertook
to charge herself with the preliminary steps and the general
furtherance of the scheme. Dear Madame Mouret, said she,
was not accustomed to begging, and she would accompany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
her on her visits and would even take several of them off her
hands altogether. By the end of a quarter of an hour she had
made the business entirely her own, and it was now she who
gave instructions to Marthe. The latter was just about to
take her leave when Monsieur de Condamin came into the
room; so she lingered on, feeling very ill at ease, however,
and not daring to say any more on the subject of her visit in
the presence of a man who was rumoured to be compromised
in that matter of the poor girls with whose shameful story the
town was ringing.</p>

<p>But Madame de Condamin explained the great scheme to
her husband, who listened with an appearance of perfect ease,
and gave utterance to the most moral sentiments. He considered
the scheme an extremely proper one.</p>

<p>'It is an idea which could only have occurred to a mother,'
he said gravely, in a tone which made it impossible to tell
whether he was serious or not. 'Plassans will be indebted to
you, madame, for a purer morality.'</p>

<p>'But I must tell you that the idea is not my own! I have
merely adopted it,' replied Marthe, made uneasy by these
praises. 'It was suggested to me by a person whom I esteem
very highly.'</p>

<p>'Who was that?' asked Madame de Condamin, with a show
of curiosity.</p>

<p>'Abbé Faujas.'</p>

<p>Then Marthe, with great frankness, told them what a high
opinion she had of the priest. She made no allusion to the
unpleasant stories that had been circulated about him, but
she represented him as a man worthy of the highest respect,
whom she was very happy to receive in her home. Madame
de Condamin nodded approvingly as she listened.</p>

<p>'I always said so!' she exclaimed. 'Abbé Faujas is a
very distinguished priest. But there are such a lot of malicious
people about! Now, however, that you receive him in your
home, they don't venture to say anything more against him;
all that calumnious talk has been cut short. The idea, you
say, is his. We shall have to persuade him, then, to take a
prominent part in putting it into execution. For the present
we will keep the matter very quiet. I can assure you that I
always liked and defended the Abbé.'</p>

<p>'I recollect talking with him, and I thought him a very
good fellow,' remarked the conservator of rivers and forests.</p>

<p>His wife silenced him with a gesture. She occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
treated him in a very cavalier style. Truth to tell, Monsieur
de Condamin alone bore the shame attaching to the equivocal
marriage which he was charged with having made; the young
woman, whom he had brought from no one knew where, had
got herself forgiven and liked by the whole town, thanks to
her pleasant ways and taking looks, to which provincial folks
are more susceptible than might be imagined.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Condamin understood that he was in the way
in this virtuous consultation.</p>

<p>'I will leave you to your good designs,' he said with a
slight touch of irony. 'I am going to smoke a cigar. Octavie,
don't forget to be dressed in good time. We are going to the
Sub-Prefecture this evening, you know.'</p>

<p>When he had left the room, the two women resumed their
conversation for a few moments longer, returning to what
they had previously been saying, expressing pity for the poor
girls who yielded to temptation, and manifesting much anxiety
to shelter them from danger. Madame de Condamin inveighed
eloquently against vice.</p>

<p>'Well, then!' she said, as she pressed Marthe's hand for
the last time, 'it is all settled, and I shall be entirely at your
service as soon as you call for my help. If you go to see
Madame Rastoil and Madame Delangre, tell them that I will
undertake to do everything, and that all we want from them
is their names. My idea is a good one, don't you think? We
won't depart a hair's breadth from it. Give my compliments
to Abbé Faujas.'</p>

<p>Marthe at once proceeded to call upon Madame Delangre,
and then upon Madame Rastoil. She found them very polite,
but less enthusiastic than Madame de Condamin. They discussed
the pecuniary side of the scheme. A large sum of
money would be required, they said; the charity of the public
would certainly never provide it, and there was a great risk of
the whole business coming to a ridiculous termination.
Marthe tried to reassure them, and plied them with figures.
Then they asked her what ladies had consented to join the
committee. The mention of Madame de Condamin's name
left them silent, but when they learned that Madame Rougon
had excused herself from joining, they became more amiable.</p>

<p>Madame Delangre had received Marthe in her husband's
private room. She was a pale little woman whose dissoluteness
had remained a matter of legend in Plassans.</p>

<p>'Indeed,' she ended by saying, 'there is nothing I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
like to see better. It would be a school of virtue for the youth
of the working-classes, and it would be the means of saving
many weak souls. I cannot refuse my assistance, for I feel
that I could be of much use to you through my husband, who
as mayor of the town is brought into continual contact with all
the influential people. But I must ask you to allow me till
to-morrow before I give a definite reply. Our position requires
us to exercise circumspection, and I should like to consult
Monsieur Delangre.'</p>

<p>In Madame Rastoil Marthe encountered a woman who was
equally listless but more prudish, and who sought for irreproachable
words when referring to the unfortunate girls who
had fallen. She was a sleek, plump person, and Marthe found
her embroidering a very gorgeous alb, between her two
daughters, whom she sent away at her visitor's first words.</p>

<p>'I am much obliged to you for having thought of me,'
she said; 'but really I am very much occupied. I am already
on several committees and I don't know whether I should have
the time. I have had some such idea as your own myself,
but my scheme was a larger one and, perhaps, more complete
and comprehensive. For a whole month I have been intending
to talk to the Bishop about it, but I have never been able to
find the time. Well! we will unite our efforts, and I will tell
you my own views, for I think you are making a mistake in
some points. Since it seems necessary, I will surrender still
more of my time. But it was only yesterday that my husband
said to me: "Really, you never attend to your own affairs;
you are always looking after other people's."'</p>

<p>Marthe glanced at her curiously, thinking of her old entanglement
with Monsieur Delangre, which folks still chuckled
over in the cafés of the Cours Sauvaire. The wives of the
mayor and the presiding judge had received the mention of
Abbé Faujas's name very suspiciously, the latter especially so.
Marthe was a little vexed at this distrust of a person for whom
she vouched; so she made a point of dwelling upon the Abbé's
good qualities, and eventually forced the two women to
acknowledge the merit of this priest, who lived a life of retirement
and supported his mother.</p>

<p>On leaving Madame Rastoil's Marthe merely had to cross
the road to reach Madame Paloque's, which was on the other
side of the Rue Balande. It was seven o'clock, but she was
anxious to make this last call, even if she were to keep Mouret
waiting for dinner and get herself scolded in consequence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
The Paloques were just about to sit down to table in a chilly
dining-room, whose prim coldness spoke of provincial penury.
Madame Paloque hastened to cover up the soup-tureen, vexed
at being thus found at table. She was very polite, humble
almost, anxious as she really felt about this visit which she
had not expected. Her husband, the judge, sat before his
empty plate with his hands upon his knees.</p>

<p>'The hussies!' he exclaimed, when Marthe spoke of the
girls of the old quarter of the town. 'I heard some nice
accounts of them to-day at court. It was they who led some
of our most respectable townspeople astray. You do wrong,
madame, to interest yourself about such vermin.'</p>

<p>'I am very much afraid,' said Madame Paloque in her turn,
'that I cannot be of much assistance to you. I know no one,
and my husband would cut his hand off rather than beg for
the smallest trifle. We have held ourselves quite aloof from
everyone, disgusted as we are with all the injustices we have
witnessed. We live here very quietly and modestly, happy
in being forgotten and let alone. Even if promotion were
offered to my husband now, he would refuse it. Wouldn't
you, my dear?'</p>

<p>The judge nodded his head in assent and they exchanged
a slight smile, while Marthe sat ill at ease in the presence
of that hideous wrinkled couple, livid with gall and bitterness,
who played so well the little comedy of feigned resignation.
Fortunately she recalled her mother's counsels.</p>

<p>'I had quite counted upon you,' she said, making herself
very pleasant. 'We shall have Madame Delangre, Madame
Rastoil, and Madame de Condamin; but, between ourselves,
those ladies will only give us their names. I should have
liked to find some lady of good status and kindly, charitable
disposition, who would have taken a stronger interest and
shown more energy in the matter, and I thought that you
would be the very person. Think what gratitude Plassans
would owe us if we could only bring such an undertaking to
a successful issue!'</p>

<p>'Of course, of course!' Madame Paloque murmured,
quite delighted at Marthe's insinuating words.</p>

<p>'I am sure you are wrong in fancying that you are without
power to assist us. It is very well known that Monsieur
Paloque is a favourite at the Sub-Prefecture; and between
ourselves I may say that he is intended to succeed Monsieur
Rastoil. Ah, now! don't try to depreciate yourselves; your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
merits are known, and it is no use your trying to hide them.
This would be a very good opportunity for Madame Paloque
to emerge a little from the obscurity and privacy in which
she keeps herself, and to let the world see what a head and
what a heart she has!'</p>

<p>The judge seemed very restless. He looked at his wife
with blinking eyes.</p>

<p>'Madame Paloque has not refused,' said he.</p>

<p>'No, certainly not,' interposed the latter. 'If you really
stand in need of me, that settles the matter. I dare say I am
only committing another piece of folly, and shall give myself
a lot of trouble without ever getting a word of thanks for it.
Monsieur Paloque can tell you of all the good works we've
done without ever saying a word about them; and you can
see for yourself what they've brought us to. Well, well, we
can't change our natures, and I suppose we shall continue
being dupes to the end! You may count upon me, dear
madame.'</p>

<p>The Paloques rose and Marthe took leave of them, thanking
them for their kindly interest. As she stopped for a
moment on the landing to liberate a flounce of her dress which
had caught between the banisters and the steps, she heard
them talking with animation on the other side of the door.</p>

<p>'They want to enlist you because they want to make use
of you!' the judge was saying in a bitter voice. 'You will
be their beast of burden.'</p>

<p>'Of course!' replied his wife, 'but you may be sure that
I'll make them pay for it with the rest!'</p>

<p>When Marthe at last got back home, it was nearly eight
o'clock. Mouret had been waiting a whole half-hour for his
dinner, and she was afraid that there would be a terrible
scene. But, when she had undressed and come downstairs,
she found her husband seated astride an overturned chair,
tranquilly beating a tattoo on the tablecloth with his fingers.
He was in a very teasing, bantering mood.</p>

<p>'Well,' said he, 'I had quite made up my mind that you
were going to spend the night in a confessional-box. Now
that you have taken to going to church, you had better give
me notice when the priests invite you, so that I can dine out.'</p>

<p>All through the dinner he indulged in witticisms of this
kind, and Marthe was more distressed by them than if he had
openly stormed at her. Two or three times she cast a glance
at him as if beseeching him to leave her in peace. But her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
looks only appeared to stimulate his wit. Octave and Désirée
laughed at it all, but Serge remained silent and mentally took
his mother's side. During dessert Rose came into the room,
looking quite scared, with the news that Monsieur Delangre
had called and wished to see madame.</p>

<p>'Hallo! have you begun to associate with the authorities
as well?' exclaimed Mouret in his sneering fashion.</p>

<p>Marthe went into the drawing-room to receive the mayor.
With much politeness the latter told her that he had felt
unwilling to wait until the morrow to congratulate her upon
her charitable idea. Madame Delangre was a little timid;
she had done wrong in not immediately promising her co-operation,
and he had now come to say in her name that
she would be delighted to serve on the committee of lady
patronesses of the Home of the Virgin. As for himself, he
would do all he could to further the success of a scheme that
would be so useful, so conducive to morality.</p>

<p>Marthe accompanied him to the street-door; and there,
as Rose held up the lamp to light the footpath, the mayor
added:</p>

<p>'Will you tell Abbé Faujas that I shall be glad to have
a little conversation with him, if he will kindly call on me?
As he has had experience of an establishment of this kind at
Besançon, he will be able to give me valuable information.
I mean the town to pay for the building, at any rate. Good-bye,
dear madame. Give my best compliments to Monsieur
Mouret, whom I won't disturb.'</p>

<p>When Abbé Faujas came down with his mother at eight
o'clock Mouret merely said to him, with a laugh:</p>

<p>'So you walked my wife off to-day, eh? Well, don't spoil
her for me too much, and don't make a saint of her.'</p>

<p>Then he turned to his card-play. He was anxious to
revenge himself on Madame Faujas, who had defeated him
three evenings in succession; and so Marthe was left free to
tell the Abbé of all she had done during the day. She seemed
full of child-like pleasure, and was still quite excited with her
afternoon. The priest made her repeat certain details, and
then promised to call on Monsieur Delangre, although he
would have preferred remaining altogether in the background.</p>

<p>'You did wrong to mention my name at all,' he said,
when he saw her so moved and yielding. 'But you are like all
other women; the best causes would be spoilt in your hands.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked at him in surprise at this harsh exclamation,
recoiling and feeling that thrill of fear which she still
occasionally experienced in the presence of his cassock. It
was as though iron hands were being laid upon her shoulders
and were forcing her into compliance with their will. Every
priest looks upon woman as an enemy; but when the Abbé
saw that she was hurt by his stern reproof he softened his
voice and said:</p>

<p>'I think only of the success of your noble design. I am
afraid that I should compromise it if I myself were to appear
in it. You know very well that I am not a favourite in the
town.'</p>

<p>Marthe, seeing him so humble, assured him that he was
mistaken, and that all the ladies had spoken of him in the
highest terms. They knew that he was supporting his mother,
and that he led a quiet, retired life worthy of the greatest
praise. Then they talked over the great scheme, dwelling on
the smallest details of it, till eleven o'clock struck. It was a
delightful evening.</p>

<p>Mouret had caught a word or two of the talk every now
and then between the deals.</p>

<p>'And so,' he said, as they were going to bed, 'so you two
are going to stamp out vice? It's a fine invention.'</p>

<p>Three days later the committee of patronesses was formally
constituted. The ladies having elected Marthe as
president, she, upon her mother's advice which she
had privately sought, immediately named Madame Paloque
treasurer. They both gave themselves a great deal of trouble
in directing circulars and looking after a host of other petty
details. In the meantime Madame de Condamin went from
the Sub-Prefecture to the Bishop's, and from the Bishop's to
the houses of various other influential persons, exhibiting
some lovely toilettes, explaining in her pretty fashion 'the
happy idea that had occurred to her,' and carrying off subscriptions
and promises of assistance. Madame Rastoil, on
the other hand, told the priests who came to her house
on the Tuesday how she had formed a plan for rescuing
unfortunate girls from vice, and then contented herself with
charging Abbé Bourrette to inquire of the Sisters of Saint-Joseph
if they would come and serve in the projected refuge;
while Madame Delangre confided to a little company of
functionaries that the town was indebted for the Home to her
husband, who had also kindly given the committee the use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
of a room at the town-hall, where they could meet and
deliberate at their ease. Plassans was speedily excited by
this pious turmoil, and soon nothing but the Home of the
Virgin was spoken of. A chorus of praise went up, and the
friends of each lady patroness made up little parties and
worked strenuously for the success of the undertaking.
Within a week subscriptions were opened in all three quarters
of the town, and as the 'Plassans Gazette' published lists of
the subscriptions, a feeling of pride was awakened, and the
most notable families vied as to which should be the most
generous.</p>

<p>Amidst all the talk on the subject Abbé Faujas's name
frequently cropped up. Although each of the lady patronesses
claimed the idea of the refuge as her own, there was a
prevailing belief that it was the Abbé who had brought it with
him from Besançon. Monsieur Delangre, indeed, made an
express statement to that effect at the meeting of the municipal
council when it was decided to purchase the building which
the diocesan architect had suggested as being best suited to
the requirements of the Home. On the previous evening the
mayor had had a lengthy conversation with the priest. They
had shaken hands most cordially on parting, and the mayor's
secretary had even heard them call each other 'my dear sir.'
This brought about quite a revolution in the Abbé's favour.
From that time he had a group of partisans who defended
him against the attacks of his enemies.</p>

<p>Besides, the Mourets vouched for Abbé Faujas's respectability.
Supported by Marthe's friendship, recognised as the
originator of a good work, which he modestly refused to
acknowledge as his own, he no longer manifested in the
streets that appearance of humility which had led him to
withdraw as much as possible from observation by keeping
in the shadow of the houses. He bravely showed his new
cassock in the sun and walked in the middle of the road.
On his way from the Rue Balande to Saint-Saturnin's he now
had to return a great number of bows. One Sunday Madame
de Condamin stopped him after Vespers on the Place in front
of the Bishop's house and kept him talking with her there for
a good half-hour.</p>

<p>'Well, your reverence,' Mouret said to him with a laugh,
'you are quite in the odour of sanctity now. One would
scarcely have anticipated that six months ago when I was
the only one to say a good word for you! But if I were you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
I shouldn't trust too much to it all; you still have the
Bishop's set against you.'</p>

<p>The priest lightly shrugged his shoulders. He knew quite
well that what hostility he still met with came from the
clergy. Abbé Fenil kept Monseigneur Rousselot trembling
beneath his rough, hard will. However, when the grand-vicar,
about the end of March, left Plassans on a short holiday, Abbé
Faujas profited by his absence to make several calls upon the
Bishop. Abbé Surin, the prelate's private secretary, reported
that the 'wretched man' had been closeted for hours with
his lordship, who had manifested an atrocious temper after
each interview. When Abbé Fenil returned, Abbé Faujas
discontinued his visits, and again drew into the background.
But the Bishop still showed himself very much disturbed, and
it was quite evident that something had occurred to upset his
careless mind. At a dinner which he gave to his clergy he
showed himself particularly friendly to Abbé Faujas, who
was still only a humble curate at Saint-Saturnin's. Abbé
Fenil then kept his thin lips more tightly closed than ever,
but inwardly cursed his penitents when they politely asked
him how he was in health.</p>

<p>And now at last Abbé Faujas manifested complete serenity.
He still led a self-denying life, but he seemed permeated by a
pleasant ease of mind. One Tuesday evening he triumphed
definitively. He was looking out of the window of his room,
enjoying the early warmth of springtide, when Monsieur
Péqueur des Saulaies's guests came into the garden of the
Sub-Prefecture and bowed to him from a distance. Madame
de Condamin was there, and carried her familiarity so far as
to wave her handkerchief to him. Just at the same time, on
the other side, some guests came to sit on the rustic seats
in front of the waterfall in Monsieur Rastoil's grounds.
Monsieur Delangre, who was leaning over the terrace of
the Sub-Prefecture, could see across Mouret's garden into
the judge's place, owing to the sloping character of the
ground.</p>

<p>'You will see,' he said, 'they won't deign even to notice
him.'</p>

<p>But he was wrong. For Abbé Fenil, having turned his
head as though by chance, took off his hat, whereupon all
the other priests who happened to be present did the same,
and Abbé Faujas returned their salute. Then, after slowly
glancing over the two sets of guests on his right and his left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
he quitted his window, carefully drawing his white and
conventual-looking curtains.</p>

<h3><a name="IX" id="IX">IX</a></h3>


<p>The month of April was very mild and warm, and in the
evenings, after dinner, the young Mourets went to amuse
themselves in the garden. Marthe and the priest, too, as they
found the dining-room become very close, also went out on to
the terrace. They sat a few steps from the open window,
just outside the stream of light which the lamp cast upon the
tall box hedges. Hid there in the deepening dusk, they discussed
all the little details connected with the Home of the
Virgin. This constant discussion of charitable matters seemed
to give a tone of additional softness to their conversation. In
front of them, between Monsieur Rastoil's huge pear-trees and
the dusky chestnuts of the Sub-Prefecture, there was a large
patch of open sky. The young people sported about under
the arbours, while every now and then the voices of Mouret
and Madame Faujas, who remained alone in the dining-room,
deeply absorbed in their game, could be heard raised in
passing altercations.</p>

<p>Sometimes Marthe, full of tender emotion, a gentle
languor that made her words fall slowly from her lips, would
check her speech as she caught sight of the golden train of
some shooting star, and smile as she threw back her head a
little and looked up at the heavens.</p>

<p>'There's another soul leaving purgatory and entering
paradise!' she murmured, while, as the priest kept silent,
she added: 'How pretty they are, those little beliefs! One
ought to be able to remain a little girl, your reverence.'</p>

<p>She no longer now mended the family linen in the evening.
She would have had to light a lamp on the terrace to see to
do it, and she preferred the gloom of the warm night, which
seemed to thrill her with peaceful happiness. Besides, she
now went out every day, which fatigued her, and when dinner
was over she had not energy enough to take up her needle.
Rose had been obliged to undertake the mending, as Mouret
was beginning to complain that his socks were all in holes.</p>

<p>To tell the truth Marthe was really very much occupied.
Besides the committee meetings over which she presided, she
had numerous other things to attend to, visits to make, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
superintendence duties to exercise. She deputed much necessary
writing and other little matters to Madame Paloque;
but she was so eager to see the Home actually established,
that she went off to the Faubourg, where the building stood,
three times a week, to make sure that the workmen were not
wasting their time. Whenever she thought that satisfactory
progress was not being made, she hurried to Saint-Saturnin's
to find the architect, and grumbled to him and begged him
not to leave the men without his supervision, growing quite
jealous, indeed, of the work which was being executed in the
church, and saying that the chapel repairs were being much
too quickly pushed forward. Monsieur Lieutaud smiled at
all this, and assured her that everything would be completed
within the stipulated time. But Abbé Faujas likewise protested
that sufficient progress was not being made, and urged
Marthe to give the architect no peace, so she ended by going
to Saint-Saturnin's every day.</p>

<p>She went thither with her brain full of figures, or absorbed
in thinking of walls that had to be pulled down and rebuilt.
The chilliness of the church cooled her excitement a little.
She dipped her fingers in the holy water and crossed herself,
by way of doing as others did. The vergers grew to know
her and bow to her, and she herself became quite familiar
with the different chapels and the sacristy, whither she sometimes
had to go in search of Abbé Faujas, and the wide
corridor and low cloisters through which she had to pass. At
the end of a month there was not a corner in Saint-Saturnin's
which she did not know. Sometimes she had to wait for the
architect, and then she would sit down in some retired chapel
and rest after her hurried walk, recapitulating in her mind
the host of things which she wanted to impress upon Monsieur
Lieutaud. The deep, palpitating silence which surrounded
her, and the dim religious light falling from the stained-glass
windows, gradually plunged her into a vague, soft reverie.
She began to love the lofty arches and the solemn bareness
of the walls, the altars draped in protecting covers, and the
chairs all arranged in order. As soon, indeed, as the padded
doors swung to behind her, she began to experience a feeling
of supreme restfulness, she forgot all the weary cares of the
world, and perfect peace permeated her being.</p>

<p>'Saint-Saturnin's is such a pleasant place,' she said in an
unguarded moment one evening before her husband, after a
close, sultry day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>'Would you like us to go and sleep there?' Mouret asked,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>Marthe felt hurt. The feeling of purely physical happiness
which she experienced in the church began to distress her
as being something wrong; and it was with a slight feeling
of trouble that she thenceforward entered Saint-Saturnin's,
trying to force herself to remain indifferent and uninfluenced
by her surroundings, just as she would have been in the big
rooms at the town hall. But in spite of herself she was deeply,
distressfully affected. It was, however, a distress to which
she willingly returned.</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas manifested no consciousness of the slow
awakening which every day went on within her. He still
retained with her the demeanour of a busy, obliging man,
putting heaven on one side. He never showed anything of
the priest. Sometimes, however, she would disturb him as he
was going to read the burial office; and he would then speak to
her for a moment between a couple of pillars in his surplice
which exhaled a vague odour of incense and wax tapers. It
was frequently a mere bricklayer's bill or some carpenter's
claim that they spoke about, and the priest would just tell
her the exact figures and then hurry away to attend to the
funeral; she remaining there, lingering in the empty nave,
while one of the vergers was extinguishing the candles. As
Faujas, when he crossed the church with her, bowed before
the high altar, she had acquired the habit of doing likewise,
at first out of a feeling of mere propriety. But afterwards
the action had become mechanical, and she now bowed when
she was quite alone. Hitherto this act of reverence had been
her only sign of devotion. Two or three times she had come
to the church on days of high ceremonial of which she had
not previously been aware: but when she saw the church was
full of worshippers and heard the pealing of the organ, she
hurried off, thrilled with sudden fear and not daring to cross
the threshold.</p>

<p>'Well!' Mouret would frequently ask her with his
sniggering laugh, 'when do you mean to take your first
communion?'</p>

<p>He was perpetually teasing her, but she never replied,
simply fixing upon him the gaze of her eyes, in which a
passing brightness glistened when he went too far. By degrees
he became more bitter, he was tired of mocking at her; and
at the end of a month he quite lost his temper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>'What sense is there in going and mixing yourself up with
a lot of priests?' he would growl at times when his dinner
was not ready when he wanted it. 'You are always away
from home now, there's no keeping you in the house for an
hour at a time! I shouldn't mind it myself, if everything
weren't going to pieces here. I never get any of my things
mended, the table is not even laid by seven o'clock, there's no
making anything out of Rose, and the whole place is left to
rack and ruin.'</p>

<p>He picked up a house-cloth that was lying about, locked
up a bottle of wine that had been left out, and began to wipe
the dust off the furniture with his fingers, working himself
up to a higher pitch of anger as he cried: 'There'll soon be
nothing left for me to do but to take up a broom and put an
apron on! You would see me do it without disturbing yourself,
I know! I might do all the work of the house without
your being any the wiser for it indeed! Do you know that I
spent a couple of hours this morning in putting this cupboard
in order? No, no, things can't go on any longer in this
way!'</p>

<p>At other times there was a disturbance about the children.
Once when Mouret came home he found Désirée 'wallowing
like a young pig' in the garden, lying on her stomach before
an ant-hole, and trying to find out what the ants might be
doing in the ground.</p>

<p>'We may be very thankful, I'm sure, that you don't sleep
away from the house as well!' he cried as soon as he caught
sight of his wife. 'Come and look at your daughter! I
wouldn't let her change her dress because I wished that you
might see what a pretty sight she is.'</p>

<p>The girl cried bitterly while her father kept turning her
round.</p>

<p>'Look at her now! Isn't she a nice spectacle? This is
the way children go on when they are left to themselves! It
isn't her fault, poor little innocent! At one time you couldn't
leave her alone for five minutes: she would be getting into
the fire, you said! Well, I expect she will be getting into the
fire now, and everything will be burnt up, and then there'll
be an end of it all!'</p>

<p>When Rose had taken Désirée away, he continued:
'You live now simply for other people's children. You
don't give a moment to your own! What a goose you must
be to go knocking yourself up for a parcel of hussies who only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
laugh at you! Go and walk about the ramparts any evening
and you will see something of the conduct of those impudent
creatures whom you talk of putting under the protection of
the Virgin!'</p>

<p>He stopped to take breath and then went on again:</p>

<p>'At all events see that Désirée is properly taken care of
before you go picking up girls from the gutter! There are
holes as big as my fist in her dress. One of these days we
shall be finding her in the garden with a leg or an arm
broken. I don't say anything about Octave or Serge, though
I should much prefer your being at home when they come
back from college. They are up to all kinds of diabolical
tricks. Only yesterday they split a couple of flag-stones on
the terrace by letting off crackers. I tell you that if you
don't keep yourself at home we shall find the whole house
blown to bits one of these days!'</p>

<p>Marthe said a few words in self-defence. She had been
obliged to go out, she urged. There was no doubt that
Mouret, who possessed an ample fund of common sense, in
spite of his proclivities for teasing and jeering, was right.
The house was getting into a most unsatisfactory state. That
once quiet spot indeed, where the sun had set so peacefully,
was becoming uproarious, left to look after itself, suffering
from the children's noisiness, the father's bursts of temper,
and the mother's careless, indifferent lassitude. In the
evening, at table, they dined badly and quarrelled amongst
themselves. Rose did just what she liked, and she, by the
way, was of opinion that her mistress was quite in the right.</p>

<p>Matters came to such a pass at last that Mouret, happening
to meet his mother-in-law, complained to her bitterly of
Marthe's conduct, although he was quite aware of the pleasure
he afforded the old lady by revealing to her the troubles of
his home.</p>

<p>'You astonish me extremely!' Félicité replied with a
smile. 'Marthe always seemed to me to be afraid of you,
and I considered her even too yielding and obedient. A
woman ought not to tremble before her husband.'</p>

<p>'Ah, yes, indeed!' cried Mouret, with a hopeless look,
'once upon a time she would have sunk into the ground to
avoid a quarrel; a mere glance was sufficient to make her do
everything I desired. But that's all quite altered now. I
may remonstrate and shout as much as I like, she still goes
her own way. She doesn't reply, she hasn't as yet got to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
flying out at me, but that will come as well, I dare say, by-and-by.'</p>

<p>Félicité then answered with some hypocrisy:</p>

<p>'I will speak to Marthe if you like. But it might, perhaps,
hurt her if I did. Matters of this kind are better kept
between husband and wife. I don't feel very uneasy about
them; I've no doubt that you'll soon get back again all the
quiet peacefulness which you used to be so proud of.'</p>

<p>Mouret shook his head with downcast eyes.</p>

<p>'No! no!' he said; 'I know myself too well. I can
make a noise, but it does no good. In reality I am as weak
as a child. People are quite wrong in supposing that I
gained my own way with my wife by force. She has generally
done what I wanted her to do, because she was quite indifferent
about everything, and would as soon do one thing as
another. Mild as she looks, she is very obstinate, I can tell
you. Well, I must try to make the best of it.'</p>

<p>Then, raising his eyes, he added:</p>

<p>'It would have been better if I had said nothing about all
this to you; but you won't mention it to anyone, will you?'</p>

<p>When Marthe went to see her mother the next day, the
latter received her with some show of coldness, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>'It is wrong of you, my dear, to show yourself so neglectful
of your husband. I saw him yesterday and he is quite
angry about it. I am well aware that he often behaves in a
very ridiculous manner, but that does not justify you in
neglecting your home.'</p>

<p>Marthe fixed her eyes upon her mother.</p>

<p>'Ah! he has been complaining about me!' she said
curtly. 'The least he could do would be to keep silent, for I
never complain about him.'</p>

<p>Then she began to talk of other matters, but Madame
Rougon brought her back to the subject of her husband by
inquiring after Abbé Faujas.</p>

<p>'Perhaps Mouret isn't very fond of the Abbé, and finds
fault with you in consequence. Is that the case, do you
think?'</p>

<p>Marthe showed great surprise.</p>

<p>'What an idea!' she exclaimed. 'What makes you
think that my husband does not like Abbé Faujas? He has
certainly never said anything to me which would lead me to
imagine such a thing. He hasn't said anything to you, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
he? Oh no! you are quite mistaken. He would go up to
their rooms to fetch them if the mother didn't come down to
have her game of cards with him.'</p>

<p>Mouret, indeed, never complained in any way about Abbé
Faujas. He joked with him a little bluntly sometimes, and
occasionally brought his name into the teasing banter with
which he tormented his wife, but that was all.</p>

<p>One morning, as he was shaving, he said to Marthe:</p>

<p>'I'll tell you what, my dear; if ever you go to confession,
take the Abbé for your director, and then your sins will, at
any rate, be kept amongst ourselves.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas heard confessions on Tuesdays and Fridays,
on which days Marthe used to avoid going to Saint-Saturnin's.
She alleged that she did not want to disturb him; but she
was really under the influence of that timid uneasiness which
disquieted her whenever she saw him in his surplice redolent
of the mysterious odours of the sacristy. One Friday, she
went with Madame de Condamin to see how the works at the
Home of the Virgin were getting on. The men were just
finishing the frontage. Madame de Condamin found fault with
the ornamentation, which, said she, was extremely mean and
characterless. At the entrance there ought to have been two
slender columns with a pointed arch, something at once light
and suggestive of religion, something that would be a credit
to the committee of lady patronesses. Marthe hesitated for a
time, but she gradually admitted that the place looked very
mean as it was. Then as the other pressed her, she promised
to speak to Monsieur Lieutaud on the subject that very day.
In order that she might keep her promise, she went to the
cathedral before returning home. It was four o'clock when
she got there, and the architect had just left. When she
asked for Abbé Faujas, a verger told her that he was confessing
in the chapel of Saint Aurelia. Then for the first time
she recollected what day it was, and replied that she could
not wait. But as she passed the chapel of Saint Aurelia on
her way out, she thought that the Abbé might, perhaps, have
already caught sight of her. The truth was that she felt
singularly faint, and so she sat down outside the chapel,
near the railing. And there she remained.</p>

<p>The sky was grey, and the church was steeped in twilight.
Here and there in the aisles, already shrouded in darkness,
gleamed a lamp, or some gilt candelabrum, or some Virgin's
silver robe; and a pale ray filtered through the great nave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
and died away on the polished oak of the stalls and benches.
Marthe had never before felt so completely overcome. Her
legs seemed to have lost all their strength, and her hands
were so heavy that she clasped them across her knees to save
herself from having to support their weight. She allowed
herself to drift into drowsiness, in which she still continued
to hear and see, but in a very soft subdued fashion. The
slight sounds wafted along beneath the vaulted roof, the
falling of a chair, the slow step of some worshipper, all filled
her with emotion, assumed a musical tone which thrilled her
to the heart; while the last glimmers of daylight and the
dusky shadows that crept up the pillars like covers of crape,
assumed in her eyes all the delicate tints of shot silk. She
gradually fell into a state of exquisite languor, in which she
seemed to melt away and die. Everything around her then
vanished, and she was thrilled with perfect happiness in her
strange, trance-like condition.</p>

<p>The sound of a voice awoke her from this state of ecstasy.</p>

<p>'I am very sorry,' said Abbé Faujas; 'I saw you, but I
could not get away.'</p>

<p>She then appeared to wake up with a start. She looked
at him. He was standing before her in the dying light, in
his surplice. His last penitent had just left, and the empty
church seemed to be growing still more solemn.</p>

<p>'You want to speak to me?' he asked.</p>

<p>Marthe made an effort to recall her thoughts.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she murmured; 'but I can't remember now. Ah
yes! it is about the frontage, which Madame de Condamin
thinks too mean. There ought to be two columns instead of
that characterless flat door. And up above one might put a
pointed arch filled with stained glass. It would look very
pretty. You understand what I mean, don't you?'</p>

<p>He gazed at her very gravely with his hands crossed over
his surplice, and his head inclined towards her; and she, still
seated, without strength to rise to her feet, went on stammering
confusedly, as though she had been taken unawares in a
sleep which she could not shake off.</p>

<p>'It would entail additional expense, of course; but we
might have columns of soft stone with a very simple moulding.
We might speak about it to the master mason, and he will tell
us how much it would cost. But we had better pay him his
last account first. It is two thousand one hundred and odd
francs, I think. We have the money in hand; Madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Paloque told me so this morning. There will be no difficulty
about that, Monsieur l'Abbé.'</p>

<p>She lowered her head, as though she felt oppressed by the
gaze that was bent upon her. When she raised it again and
met the priest's eyes, she clasped her hands together, after the
manner of a child seeking forgiveness, and she burst into sobs.
The priest allowed her to weep, still standing in silence in
front of her. Then she fell on her knees before him, weeping
behind her hands, with which she covered her face.</p>

<p>'Get up, I pray you,' said Abbé Faujas gently. 'It is
before God that you should go and kneel.'</p>

<p>He helped her to rise and he sat down beside her. They
talked together for a long time in low tones. The night had
now fully fallen, and the lamps set golden specks gleaming
through the black depths of the church. The murmur of their
voices alone disturbed the silence in front of the chapel of
Saint Aurelia. From the priest streamed a flood of words
after each of Marthe's weak broken answers. When at last
they rose, he seemed to be refusing her some favour which she
was seeking with persistence. And leading her towards the
door, he raised his voice as he said:</p>

<p>'No! I cannot, I assure you I cannot. It would be better
for you to take Abbé Bourrette.'</p>

<p>'I am in great need of your advice,' Marthe murmured,
beseechingly. 'I think that with your help everything would
be easy to me.'</p>

<p>'You are mistaken,' he replied, in a sterner voice. 'On
the contrary, I fear that my direction would be prejudicial
to you to begin with. Abbé Bourrette is the priest you want,
I assure you. Later on, I may perhaps give you a different
reply.'</p>

<p>Marthe obeyed the priest's injunctions, and on the morrow
the worshippers at Saint-Saturnin's were surprised to see
Madame Mouret kneel before Abbé Bourrette's confessional.
Two days later nothing but this conversion was spoken of in
Plassans. Abbé Faujas's name was pronounced with subtle
smiles by certain people, but on the whole the impression was
a good one and in favour of the Abbé. Madame Rastoil complimented
Madame Mouret in full committee, and Madame
Delangre professed to see in the matter a first blessing
vouchsafed by God who rewarded the lady patronesses for
their good work by touching the heart of the only one
amongst them who had not conformed with the requirements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
of religion. Madame de Condamin, taking Marthe
aside, said to her:</p>

<p>'You have done right, my dear. What you have done is
a necessity for a woman; and, besides, as soon as one begins
to go about a little, it is necessary to go to church.'</p>

<p>The only matter of astonishment was her choice of Abbé
Bourrette. That worthy man almost entirely confined himself
to hearing the confessions of young girls. The ladies
found him 'so very uninteresting.' On the Thursday at the
Rougons' reception, before Marthe's arrival, the matter was
talked over in a corner of the green drawing-room, and it
was Madame Paloque with her waspish tongue who summed
up the matter.</p>

<p>'Abbé Faujas has done quite right in not keeping her
himself,' said she, with a twist of her mouth that made her
still more hideous than usual; 'Abbé Bourrette is very
successful in saving souls and appearances also.'</p>

<p>When Marthe came that evening her mother stepped forward
to welcome her, and kissed her affectionately with
some ostentation before the company. She herself had
made her peace with God on the morrow of the Coup
d'État. She was of opinion that Abbé Faujas might now
venture to return to the green drawing-room; but he excused
himself, making a pretext of his work and his love
of privacy. Madame Rougon then fancied that he was
planning a triumphal return for the following winter. The
Abbé's success was certainly on the increase. For the first
few months his only penitents had come from the vegetable-market
held behind the cathedral, poor hawkers, to
whose dialect he had quietly listened without always
being able to understand it; but now, especially since all
the talk there had been in connection with the Home of
the Virgin, he had a crowd of well-to-do citizens' wives
and daughters dressed in silk kneeling before his confessional-box.
When Marthe quietly mentioned that he would
not receive her amongst his penitents, Madame de Condamin
was seized with a sudden whim, and deserted her director,
the senior curate of Saint-Saturnin's, who was greatly distressed
thereby, to transfer the guardianship of her soul to
Abbé Faujas. Such a distinction as this gave the latter a
firm position in Plassans society.</p>

<p>When Mouret learned that his wife now went to confession,
he merely said to her:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>'You have been doing something wrong lately, I suppose,
since you find it necessary to go and tell all your affairs to
a parson?'</p>

<p>In the midst of all this pious excitement he seemed to isolate
himself and shut himself up in his own narrow and
monotonous life still further. When his wife reproached him
for complaining to her mother, he answered:</p>

<p>'Yes, you are right; it was wrong of me. It is foolish to
give people any pleasure by telling them of one's troubles.
However, I promise you that I won't give your mother this
satisfaction a second time. I have been thinking matters
over, and the house may topple down on our heads before I'll
go whimpering to anyone again.'</p>

<p>From that time he never made any disparaging remarks
about the management of the house or scolded his wife in
the presence of strangers, but professed himself, as formerly,
the happiest of men. This effort of sound sense cost him
little, for he saw that it would tend to his comfort, which
was the object of his constant thoughts. He even exaggerated
his assumption of the part of a contented methodical
citizen who took pleasure in living. Marthe only became
aware of his impatience by his restless pacing up and down.
For whole weeks he refrained from teasing or fault-finding
as far as she was concerned, while upon Rose and his children
he constantly poured forth his jeers, scolding them too
from morning till night for the slightest shortcomings.</p>

<p>Previously he had only been economical, now he became
miserly.</p>

<p>'There is no sense in spending money in the way we are
doing,' he grumbled to Marthe. 'I'll be bound you are giving
it all to those young hussies of yours. But it's quite sufficient
for you to waste your time over them. Listen to me, my dear.
I will give you a hundred francs a month for housekeeping,
and if you will persist in giving money to girls who don't
deserve it, you must save it out of your dress allowance.'</p>

<p>He kept firmly to his word, and the very next month he
refused to let Marthe buy a pair of boots on the pretext that
it would disarrange his accounts, and that he had given her
full notice and warning. One evening his wife found him
weeping bitterly in their bedroom. All her kindness of heart
was aroused, and she clasped him in her arms and besought
him to tell her what distressed him. But he roughly tore
himself away from her and told her that he was not crying at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
all, but simply had a bad headache. It was that, said he,
which made his eyes red.</p>

<p>'Do you think,' he exclaimed, 'that I am such a simpleton
as you are to cry?'</p>

<p>She felt much hurt. The next day Mouret affected great
gaiety; but some days afterwards, when Abbé Faujas and his
mother came downstairs after dinner, he refused to play his
usual game of piquet. He did not feel clear-headed enough
for it, he said. On the next few nights he made other excuses,
and so the games were broken off, and everyone went out on
the terrace. Mouret seated himself in front of his wife and
the Abbé, doing all he could to speak as much and as frequently
as possible; while Madame Faujas sat a few yards
away in the gloom, quite silent and still, with her hands upon
her knees, like one of those legendary figures keeping guard
over a treasure with the stern fidelity of a crouching dog.</p>

<p>'Fine evening!' Mouret used to say every night. 'It is
much pleasanter here than in the dining-room. It is very wise
of you to come out and enjoy the fresh air. Ah! there's a
shooting-star! Did your reverence see it? I've heard say
that it's Saint Peter lighting his pipe up yonder.'</p>

<p>He laughed, but Marthe kept quite grave, vexed by his
attempts at pleasantry, which spoilt her enjoyment of the
expanse of sky that spread between Monsieur Rastoil's
pear-trees and the chestnuts of the Sub-Prefecture. Sometimes
he would pretend to be unaware that she conformed
with the requirements of religion, and he would take the Abbé
aside and tell him that he relied on him to effect the salvation
of the whole house. At other times he could never begin a
sentence without saying in a bantering tone, 'Now that my
wife goes to confession&mdash;' Then having grown tired of this
subject, he began to listen to what was being said in the
neighbouring gardens, trying to catch the faint sounds of
voices which rose in the calm night air, as the distant noises
of Plassans were hushed.</p>

<p>'Ah! those are the voices of Monsieur de Condamin and
Doctor Porquier!' he said, straining his ear towards the
Sub-Prefecture. 'They are making fun of the Paloques.
Did you hear Monsieur Delangre saying in his falsetto,
"Ladies, you had better come in, the air is growing cool"?
Don't you think that little Delangre always talks as though
he had swallowed a reed-pipe?'</p>

<p>Then he turned his head towards the Rastoils' garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>'They haven't anyone there to-night,' he said; 'I can't
hear anything. Ah, yes! those big geese the daughters are
by the waterfall. The elder one talks just as though she
were gobbling pebbles. Every evening they sit there jabbering
for a good hour. They can't want all that time to tell
each other about the matrimonial offers they have had. Ah!
they are all there! There's Abbé Surin, with a voice like a
flute; and Abbé Fenil, who would do for a rattle on Good
Friday. There are sometimes a score of them huddled
together, without stirring a finger, in that garden. I believe
they all go there to listen to what we say.'</p>

<p>While he went chattering on in this manner Abbé Faujas
and Marthe merely spoke a few words, chiefly in reply to his
questions. Generally they sat apart from him with their
faces raised to the sky and their eyes gazing into space. One
evening Mouret fell asleep. Then, inclining their heads towards
each other, they began to talk in subdued tones; while
some few yards away, Madame Faujas, with her hands upon
her knees, her eyes wide open and her ears on the strain, yet
never seeing or hearing anything, seemed to be keeping watch
for them.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="X" id="X">X</a></h3>


<p>The summer passed away, and Abbé Faujas seemed in no
hurry to derive any advantage from his increasing popularity.
He still kept himself in seclusion at the Mourets', delighting
in the solitude of the garden, to which he now came down
during the day-time. He read his breviary as he slowly
walked with bent head up and down the green arbour at the
far end. Sometimes he would close his book, still further
slacken his steps, and seem to be buried in deep reverie.
Mouret, who used to watch him, at last became impatient
and irritated at seeing that black figure walking to and fro
for hours together behind his fruit-trees.</p>

<p>'One has no privacy left,' he muttered. 'I can't lift my
eyes now without catching sight of that cassock. He is
like a crow, that fellow there, with his round eyes that always
seem to be on the look-out for something. I don't believe
in his fine disinterested airs.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not till early in September that the Home of the
Virgin was completed. In the provinces workmen are painfully
slow; though it must be stated that the lady patronesses
had twice upset Monsieur Lieutaud's designs in favour of
ideas of their own. When the committee took possession of
the building they rewarded the architect for the complaisance
he had manifested by lavishing the highest praises upon him.
Everything seemed to them perfectly satisfactory. The
rooms were large, the communications were excellent, and
there was a courtyard planted with trees and embellished
with two small fountains. Madame de Condamin was particularly
charmed with the façade, which was one of her
own ideas. Over the door, the words 'Home of the Virgin'
were carved in gold letters on a slab of black marble.</p>

<p>On the occasion of the opening of the Home there was
a very affecting ceremony. The Bishop, attended by the
Chapter, came in person to install the Sisters of Saint
Joseph, who had been authorised to work the institution. A
troop of some fifty girls of from eight to fifteen years of age
had been collected together from the streets of the old quarter
of the town, and all that had been required from the parents
to obtain admission for their children had been a declaration
that their avocations necessitated their absence from home
during the entire day. Monsieur Delangre made a speech
which was much applauded. He explained at considerable
length, and in a magnificent style, the details and arrangements
of this new refuge, which he called 'the school of
virtue and labour, where young and interesting creatures
would be kept safe from wicked temptations.' A delicate
allusion, towards the end of the speech, to the real promoter
of the Home, Abbé Faujas, attracted much notice. The Abbé
was present amongst the other priests, and his fine, grave
face remained perfectly calm and tranquil when all eyes
were turned upon him. Marthe blushed on the platform,
where she was sitting in the midst of the lady patronesses.</p>

<p>When the ceremony was over, the Bishop expressed a
desire to inspect the building in every detail; and, notwithstanding
the evident annoyance of Abbé Fenil, he sent for
Abbé Faujas, whose big black eyes had never for a moment
quitted him, and requested him to be good enough to act as
his guide, adding aloud with a smile, that he was sure he
could not find a better one. This little speech was circulated
amongst the departing spectators, and in the evening all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Plassans commented upon the Bishop's favourable demeanour
towards Abbé Faujas.</p>

<p>The lady patronesses had reserved for themselves one of
the rooms in the Home. Here they provided a collation for
the Bishop, who ate a biscuit and drank two sips of Malaga,
while saying a polite word or two to each of them. This
brought the pious festival to a happy conclusion, for both
before and during the ceremony there had been heart-burnings
and rivalries among the ladies, whom the delicate
praises of Monseigneur Rousselot quite restored to good
humour. When they were left to themselves, they declared
that everything had gone off exceedingly well, and they
profusely praised the Bishop. Madame Paloque alone looked
sour. The prelate had somehow forgotten her when he was
distributing his compliments.</p>

<p>'You were quite right,' she said in a fury to her husband,
when she got home again; 'I have just been made a convenience
in that silly nonsense of theirs. It's a fine idea,
indeed, to bring all those corrupt hussies together. I have
given up all my time to them, and that big simpleton of a
Bishop, who trembles before his own clergy, can't even say
thank you. Just as if that Madame de Condamin had done
anything, indeed. She is far too much occupied in showing
off her dresses! Ah! we know quite enough about her,
don't we? The world will hear something about her one of
these days that will surprise it a little! Thank goodness,
we've nothing to conceal. And that Madame Delangre and
Madame Rastoil, too&mdash;well, it wouldn't be difficult to tell
tales about them that would cover them with blushes! And
they never stirred out of their drawing-rooms, they haven't
taken half the trouble about the matter that I have! Then
there's that Madame Mouret, with her pretence of managing
the whole business, though she really did nothing but hang
on to the cassock of her Abbé Faujas! She's another
hypocrite of whom we shall hear some pretty things one of
these days! And yet they could all get a polite speech, while
there wasn't a word for me! I'm nothing but a mere
convenience, they treat me like a dog! But things sha'n't
go on like this, Paloque, I tell you. The dog will turn and
bite them before long!'</p>

<p>From that time forward Madame Paloque showed herself
much less accommodating. She became very irregular in
her secretarial work, and declined to perform any duties that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
she did not fancy, till at last the lady patronesses began to
talk of employing a paid secretary. Marthe mentioned these
worries to Abbé Faujas and asked him if he could recommend
a suitable man.</p>

<p>'Don't trouble yourself to look for anyone,' he said, 'I
dare say I can find you a fit person. Give me two or three
days.'</p>

<p>For some time past he had been frequently receiving
letters bearing the Besançon postmark, They were all in
the same handwriting, a large, ugly hand. Rose, who took
them up to him, remarked that he seemed vexed at the
mere sight of the envelopes.</p>

<p>'He looks quite put out,' she said. 'You may depend
upon it that it's no great favourite of his who writes to him
so often.'</p>

<p>Mouret's old curiosity was roused by this correspondence.
One day he took up one of the letters himself with a pleasant
smile, telling the Abbé, as an excuse for his own appearance,
that Rose was not in the house. The Abbé probably saw
through Mouret's cunning, for he assumed an expression of
great pleasure, as though he had been impatiently expecting
the letter. But Mouret did not allow himself to be deceived
by this piece of acting, he stayed outside the door on the
landing and glued his ear to the key-hole.</p>

<p>'From your sister again, isn't it?' asked Madame Faujas,
in her hard voice. 'Why does she worry you in that way?'</p>

<p>There was a short silence, after which came a sound of
paper being roughly crumpled, and the Abbé said, with evident
displeasure:</p>

<p>'It's always the same old story. She wants to come to us
and bring her husband with her, so that we may get him a
situation somewhere. She seems to think that we are
wallowing in gold. I'm afraid they will be doing something
rash&mdash;perhaps taking us by surprise some fine morning.'</p>

<p>'No, no! we can't do with them here, Ovide!' his
mother replied. 'They have never liked you; they have
always been jealous of you. Trouche is a scamp and Olympe
is quite heartless. They would want everything for themselves,
and they would compromise you and interfere with
your work.'</p>

<p>Mouret was too much excited by the meanness of the act
he was committing to be able to hear well, and, besides, he
thought that one of them was coming to the door, so he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
hurried away. He took care not to mention what he had
done. A few days later Abbé Faujas, in his presence, while
they were all out on the terrace, gave Marthe a definite reply
respecting the Secretaryship at the Home.</p>

<p>'I think I can recommend you a suitable person,' he said,
in his calm way. 'It is a connection of my own, my brother-in-law,
who is coming here from Besançon in a few days.'</p>

<p>Mouret became very attentive, while Marthe appeared
delighted.</p>

<p>'Oh, that is excellent!' she exclaimed. 'I was feeling
very much bothered about finding a suitable person. You
see, with all those young girls, we must have a person of unexceptionable
morality, but of course a connection of yours&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' interrupted the priest; 'my sister had a little
hosiery business at Besançon, which she has been obliged to
give up on account of her health; and now she is anxious to
join us again, as the doctors have ordered her to live in the
south. My mother is very much pleased.'</p>

<p>'I'm sure she must be,' said Marthe. 'I dare say it grieved
you very much to have to separate, and you will be very glad
to be together again. I'll tell you what you must do. There
are a couple of rooms upstairs that you don't use; why
shouldn't your sister and her husband have them? They
have no children, have they?'</p>

<p>'No, there are only their two selves. I had, indeed,
thought for a moment of giving them those two rooms; but I
was afraid of displeasing you by bringing other people into
your house.'</p>

<p>'Not at all, I assure you. You are very quiet people.'</p>

<p>She checked herself suddenly, for her husband was
tugging at her dress. He did not want to have the Abbé's
relations in the house, for he remembered in what terms
Madame Faujas had spoken of her daughter and son-in-law.</p>

<p>'The rooms are very small,' he began; 'and Monsieur
l'Abbé would be inconvenienced. It would be better for all
parties that his sister should take lodgings somewhere else;
there happen to be some rooms vacant just now at the
Paloques' house, over the way.'</p>

<p>There was a dead pause in the conversation. The priest
said nothing, but gazed up into the sky. Marthe thought he
was offended, and she felt much distressed at her husband's
bluntness. After a moment she could no longer endure the
embarrassing silence. 'Well, it's settled then,' she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
without any attempt at skill in knitting the broken threads of
the conversation together again, 'Rose shall help your mother
to clean the rooms. My husband was only thinking about
your own personal convenience; but, of course, if you wish it,
it is not for us to prevent you from disposing of the rooms in
any way you like.'</p>

<p>Mouret was quite angry when he again found himself
alone with his wife.</p>

<p>'I can't understand you at all!' he cried. 'When first I
let the rooms to the Abbé, you were quite displeased, and
seemed to hate the thought of having even so much as a cat
brought into the house; and now I believe you would be
perfectly willing for the Abbé to bring the whole of his
relations, down to his third and fourth cousins. Didn't you
feel me tugging at your dress? You might have known that
I didn't want those people. They are not very respectable
folks.'</p>

<p>'How do you know that?' cried Marthe, annoyed by this
accusation. 'Who told you so?'</p>

<p>'Who, indeed? It was Abbé Faujas himself. I overheard
him one day while he was talking to his mother.'</p>

<p>She looked at him keenly; and he blushed slightly beneath
her gaze as he stammered:</p>

<p>'Well, it is sufficient that I do know. The sister is a
heartless creature and her husband is a scamp. It's of no
use your putting on that air of insulted majesty; those were
their own words, and I'm inventing nothing. I don't want to
have those people here, do you understand? The old lady
herself was the first to object to her daughter coming here.
The Abbé now seems to have changed his mind. I don't
know what has led him to alter his opinion. It's some fresh
mystery of his. He's going to make use of them somehow.'</p>

<p>Marthe shrugged her shoulders and allowed her husband
to rail on. He told Rose not to clean the rooms, but Rose
now only obeyed her mistress's orders. For five days his
anger vented itself in bitter words and furious recriminations.
In Abbé Faujas's presence he confined himself to sulking, for he
did not dare to attack the priest openly. Then, as usual, he
ended by submitting, and ceased to rail at the people who were
coming. But he drew his purse-strings still tighter, isolated
himself, shut himself up more and more in his own selfish
existence. When the Trouches arrived one October evening,
he merely exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>'The deuce! they don't look a nice couple. What faces
they have!'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas did not appear very desirous that his sister
and brother-in-law should be seen on that occasion. His
mother took up a position by the street-door, and as soon as
she caught sight of them turning out of the Place of the Sub-Prefecture,
she glanced uneasily behind her into the hall and
the kitchen. Luck was, however, against her, for just as the
Trouches arrived, Marthe, who was going out, came up from
the garden, followed by her children.</p>

<p>'Ah! there you all are!' she said, with a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>Madame Faujas, who was generally so completely mistress
of herself, could not suppress a slight show of confusion as she
stammered a word or two of reply. For some moments they
stood confronting and scrutinising each other in the hall.
Mouret had hurriedly mounted the steps and Rose had taken
up her position at the kitchen door.</p>

<p>'You must be very glad to be together again,' said Marthe,
addressing Madame Faujas.</p>

<p>Then, noticing the feeling of embarrassment which was
keeping them all silent, she turned towards Trouche and
added:</p>

<p>'You arrived by the five o'clock train, I suppose? How
long were you in getting here from Besançon?'</p>

<p>'Seventeen hours in the train,' Trouche replied, opening
a toothless mouth. 'It is no joke that, in a third-class
carriage, I can tell you. One gets pretty well shaken up
inside.'</p>

<p>Then he laughed with a peculiar clattering of his jaws.
Madame Faujas cast a very angry glance at him, and he
began to fumble mechanically at his greasy overcoat, trying
to fasten a button that was no longer there, and pressing to
his thighs (doubtless in order to hide some stains) a couple of
cardboard bonnet-boxes which he was carrying, one green
and the other yellow. His red throat was perpetually gurgling
beneath a twisted, ragged black neckcloth, over which appeared
the edge of a dirty shirt. In his wrinkled face, which seemed
to reek with vice, there glistened two little black eyes that
rolled about incessantly, examining everybody and everything
with an expression of astonishment and covetousness. They
looked like the eyes of a thief studying a house to which he
means to return in order to plunder it some night.</p>

<p>Mouret fancied that Trouche was examining the fastenings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>'That fellow,' he thought to himself, 'looks as though he
were getting the patterns of the locks into his head!'</p>

<p>Olympe was conscious that her husband had made a
vulgar remark. She was a tall, slight woman, fair and faded,
with a flat plain face. She carried a little deal box and a big
bundle tied up in a tablecloth.</p>

<p>'We have brought some pillows with us,' she said,
glancing at the bundle. 'Pillows come in very usefully in a
third-class carriage; they make one quite as comfortable as if
one were travelling first-class. It is a great saving, going
third, and it is of no use throwing money away, is it?'</p>

<p>'Certainly not,' Marthe replied, somewhat surprised by the
appearance and language of the new-comers.</p>

<p>Olympe now came forward and went on talking in an
ingratiating way.</p>

<p>'It's the same thing with clothes,' said she; 'when I set
off on a journey I put on my shabbiest things. I told Honoré
that his old overcoat was quite good enough. And he has got
his old work-day trousers on too, trousers that he's quite tired
of wearing. You see I selected my worse dress; it is actually
in holes, I believe. This shawl was mother's; I used to iron
on it at home; and this bonnet I'm wearing is an old one
that I only put on when I go to the wash-house; but it's quite
good enough to get spoilt with the dust, isn't it, madame?'</p>

<p>'Certainly, certainly,' replied Marthe, trying to force a
smile.</p>

<p>Just at this moment a stern voice was heard from the top
of the stairs, calling sharply: 'Well! now, mother!'</p>

<p>Mouret raised his head and saw Abbé Faujas leaning
against the second-floor banisters, looking very angry, and
bending over, at the risk of falling, to get a better view of
what was going on in the passage. He had heard a sound of
talking and had been waiting there for a moment or two in
great impatience.</p>

<p>'Come, mother, come!' he cried again.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, we are coming up,' answered Madame Faujas,
trembling at the sound of her son's angry voice.</p>

<p>Then turning to the Trouches, she said:</p>

<p>'Come along, my children, we must go upstairs. Let us
leave madame to attend to her business.'</p>

<p>But the Trouches did not seem to hear; they appeared
quite satisfied to remain in the passage, and they looked about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
them with a well-pleased air, as though the house had just
been presented to them.</p>

<p>'It is very nice, very nice indeed, isn't it, Honoré?'
Olympe said. 'After what Ovide wrote in his letters we
scarcely expected to find it so nice as this, did we? But I
told you that we ought to come here, and that we should do
better here, and I am right, you see.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, we ought to be very comfortable here,' Trouche
murmured. 'The garden, too, seems a pretty big one.'</p>

<p>Then addressing Mouret, he inquired:</p>

<p>'Do you allow your lodgers to walk in the garden, sir?'</p>

<p>Before Mouret had time to reply, Abbé Faujas, who had
come downstairs, cried out in thundering tones:</p>

<p>'Come, Trouche! Come, Olympe!'</p>

<p>They turned round; and when they saw him standing on
the steps looking terribly angry, they fairly quailed and
meekly followed him. The Abbé went up the stairs in front
of them without saying another word, without even seeming
to observe the presence of Mouret, who stood gazing after the
singular procession. Madame Faujas smiled at Marthe to
take away the awkwardness of the situation as she brought
up the rear.</p>

<p>Marthe then went out, and Mouret, left to himself, lingered
a moment or two in the passage. Upstairs, on the second
floor, doors were being noisily banged. Then loud voices
were heard, and presently there came dead silence.</p>

<p>'Has he locked them up separately, I wonder?' said
Mouret to himself, with a laugh. 'Well, anyhow, they are
not a nice family.'</p>

<p>On the very next day, Trouche, respectably dressed,
entirely in black, shaven, and with his scanty hair carefully
brushed over his temples, was presented by Abbé Faujas to
Marthe and the lady patronesses. He was forty-five years of
age, wrote a first-rate hand, and was said to have kept the
books of a mercantile house for a long time. The ladies at
once installed him as secretary. His duties were to represent
the committee, and employ himself in certain routine work
from ten till four in an office on the first floor of the Home.
His salary was to be fifteen hundred francs.</p>

<p>'Those good people are very quiet, you see,' Marthe
remarked to her husband a few days afterwards.</p>

<p>Indeed the Trouches made no more noise than the Faujases.
Two or three times Rose asserted that she had heard quarrels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
between the mother and daughter, but the Abbé's grave voice
had immediately restored peace. Trouche went out every
morning punctually at a quarter to ten, and came back again
at a quarter past four. He never went out in the evening.
Olympe occasionally went shopping with Madame Faujas, but
she was never seen to come down the stairs by herself.</p>

<p>The window of the room in which the Trouches slept
overlooked the garden. It was the last one on the right, in
front of the trees of the Sub-Prefecture. Big curtains of red
calico, with a yellow border, hung behind the glass panes,
making a strong contrast, when seen from outside, with the
priest's white ones. The window was invariably kept closed.
One evening when Abbé Faujas and his mother were out on
the terrace with the Mourets, a slight involuntary cough was
heard, and as the priest raised his head with an expression of
annoyance, he caught sight of Olympe and her husband leaning
out of the window. For a moment or two he kept his
eyes turned upwards, thus interrupting his conversation with
Marthe. At this the Trouches disappeared; and those below
heard the window-catch being fastened.</p>

<p>'You had better go upstairs, I think, mother,' said the
priest. 'I am afraid you may be catching cold out here.'</p>

<p>Madame Faujas wished them all good-night; and, when
she had retired, Marthe resumed the conversation by asking
in her kindly way:</p>

<p>'Is your sister worse? I have not seen her for a week.'</p>

<p>'She has great need of rest,' the priest curtly answered.</p>

<p>However, Marthe's sympathetic interest made her continue
the subject.</p>

<p>'She shuts herself up too much,' said she; 'the fresh air
would do her good. These October evenings are still quite
warm. Why doesn't she ever come out into the garden?
She has never set foot in it. You know that it is entirely at
your disposal.'</p>

<p>The priest muttered a few vague words of excuse, and then
Mouret, to increase his embarrassment, manifested still greater
amiability than his wife's.</p>

<p>'That's just what I was saying this morning,' he began.
'Monsieur l'Abbé's sister might very well bring her sewing
out here in the sun in the afternoons, instead of keeping herself
shut in upstairs. Anyone would think that she daren't
even show herself at the window. She isn't frightened of us,
I hope! We are not such terrible people as all that! And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Monsieur Trouche, too, he hurries up the stairs, four steps at
a time. Tell them to come and spend an evening with us now
and then. They must be frightfully dull up in that room of
theirs, all alone.'</p>

<p>The Abbé did not seem to be in the humour that evening
to submit to his landlord's pleasantry. He looked him
straight in the face, and said very bluntly:</p>

<p>'I am much obliged to you, but there is little probability
of their accepting your invitation. They are tired in the
evening, and they go to bed. And, besides, that is the best
thing they can do.'</p>

<p>'Just as they like, my dear sir,' replied Mouret, vexed by
the Abbé's rough manner.</p>

<p>When he was alone again with Marthe, he said to her:
'Does the Abbé, I wonder, think he can persuade us that
the moon is made of green cheese? It's quite clear that he
is afraid that those scamps he has taken in will play him some
bad trick or other. Didn't you see how sharply he kept his
eye on them this evening when he caught sight of them at
the window? They were spying out at us up there. There
will be a bad end to all this!'</p>

<p>Marthe was now living in a state of blessed calm. She
no longer felt troubled by Mouret's raillery; the gradual
growth of faith within her filled her with exquisite joy, she
glided softly and slowly into a life of pious devotion, which
seemed to lull her with a sweet restfulness. Abbé Faujas
still avoided speaking to her of God. He remained merely a
friend, simply exercising influence over her by his grave
demeanour and the vague odour of incense exhaled by his
cassock. On two or three occasions when she was alone with
him she had again broken out into fits of nervous sobbing,
without knowing why, but finding a happiness in thus allowing
herself to weep. On each of these occasions the Abbé had
merely taken her hands in silence, calming her with his serene
and authoritative gaze. When she wanted to tell him of her
strange attacks of sadness, or her secret joys, or her need of
guidance, he smiled and hushed her, telling her that these
matters were not his concern, and that she must speak of
them to Abbé Bourrette. Then she retired completely within
herself and remained trembling; while the priest seemed to
assume still colder reserve than before, and strode away from
her like some unheeding god at whose feet she wished to pour
out her soul in humiliation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>Marthe's chief occupation now was attending the various
religious services and works in which she took part. In the
vast nave of Saint-Saturnin's she felt perfectly happy; it was
there that she experienced the full sweetness of that purely
physical restfulness which she sought. She there forgot
everything: it was like an immense window open upon
another life, a life that was wide and infinite, and full of an
emotion which thrilled and satisfied her. But she still felt
some fear of the church, and she went there with a feeling of
uneasy bashfulness, and a touch of nervous shame, that made
her glance behind her as she passed through the doorway,
to see if anyone was watching her. Then, once inside, she
abandoned herself, everything around her seemed to assume a
melting softness, even the unctuous voice of Abbé Bourrette,
who, after he had confessed her, sometimes kept her on her
knees for a few minutes longer, while he spoke to her about
Madame Rastoil's dinners or the Rougons' last reception.</p>

<p>Marthe often returned home in a condition of complete
prostration. Religion seemed to break her down. Rose had
become all-powerful in the house. She scolded Mouret,
found fault with him because he dirtied too much linen, and
let him have his dinner at her own hours. She even tried
to convert him.</p>

<p>'Madame does quite right to live a Christian life,' said she.
'You will be damned, sir, you will, and it will only be right,
for you are not a good man at heart, no, you are not! You
ought to go with your wife to mass next Sunday morning.'</p>

<p>Mouret shrugged his shoulders. He let things take their
own course, and sometimes even did a bit of house-work himself,
taking a turn or two with the broom when he thought
that the dining-room looked particularly dusty. The children
gave him most trouble. It was vacation-time, and, as their
mother was scarcely ever at home, Désirée and Octave&mdash;who
had again failed in his examination for his degree&mdash;turned
the place upside down. Serge was poorly, kept his bed, and
spent whole days in reading in his room. He had become
Abbé Faujas's favourite, and the priest lent him books.
Mouret thus spent two dreadful months, at his wits' end how
to manage his young folks. Octave was a special trouble to
him, and as he did not feel inclined to keep him at home till
the end of the vacation, he determined that he should not
again return to college, but should be sent to some business-house
at Marseilles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>'Since you won't look after them at all,' he said to Marthe,
'I must find some place or other to put them in. I am quite
worn out with them all, and I won't have them at home any
longer. It's your own fault if it causes you any grief. Octave
is quite unbearable. He will never pass his examination, and
it will be much better to teach him at once how to gain his
own living instead of letting him idle his time away with a
lot of good-for-nothings. One meets him roaming all over
the town.'</p>

<p>Marthe was very much distressed. She seemed to awake
from a dream on hearing that one of her children was about
to leave her. She succeeded in getting the departure postponed
for a week, during which she remained more at home,
and resumed her active life. But she quickly dropped back
again into her previous state of listless languor; and on the
day that Octave came to kiss her, telling her that he was to
leave for Marseilles in the evening, she had lost all strength
and energy, and contented herself with giving him some good
advice.</p>

<p>Mouret came back from the railway station with a very
heavy heart. He looked about him for his wife, and found
her in the garden, crying under the arbour. Then he gave
vent to his feelings.</p>

<p>'There! that's one the less!' he exclaimed. 'You ought
to feel glad of it. You will be able to go prowling about the
church now as much as you like. Make your mind easy, the
other two won't be here long. I shall keep Serge with me as
he is a very quiet lad and is rather young as yet to go and
read for the bar; but if he's at all in your way, just let me
know, and I will free you of him at once. As for Désirée,
I shall send her to her nurse.'</p>

<p>Marthe went on weeping in silence.</p>

<p>'But what would you have?' he continued. 'You can't
be both in and out. Since you have taken to keeping away
from home, your children have become indifferent to you.
That's logic, isn't it? Besides it is necessary to find room
for all the people who are now living in our house. It isn't
nearly big enough, and we shall be lucky if we don't get
turned out of doors ourselves.'</p>

<p>He had raised his eyes as he spoke, and was looking at
the windows of the second-floor. Then, lowering his voice,
he added:</p>

<p>'Don't go on crying in that ridiculous way! They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
watching you. Don't you see those eyes peeping between
the red curtains? They are the eyes of the Abbé's sister; I
know them well enough. You may depend on seeing them
there all day long. The Abbé himself may be a decent
fellow, but as for those Trouches, I know they are always
crouching behind their curtains like wolves waiting to spring
on one. I feel quite certain that if the Abbé didn't prevent
them, they would come down in the night to steal my pears.
Dry your tears, my dear; you may be quite sure that they
are enjoying our disagreement. Even though they have been
the cause of the boy's going away, that is no reason why we
should let them see what a trouble his departure has been to
us both.'</p>

<p>His voice broke, and he himself seemed on the point of
sobbing. Marthe, quite heart-broken, deeply touched by
his last words, was prompted to throw herself into his
arms. But they were afraid of being observed; and besides
they felt as if there were some obstacle between them that
prevented them from coming together. So they separated,
while Olympe's eyes still glistened between the red curtains
upstairs.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="XI" id="XI">XI</a></h3>


<p>One morning Abbé Bourrette made his appearance, his face
betokening the greatest distress. As soon as he caught sight
of Marthe on the steps, he hurried up to her and, seizing her
hands and pressing them, he stammered:</p>

<p>'Poor Compan! it is all over with him! he is dying! I am
going upstairs, I must see Faujas at once.'</p>

<p>When Marthe showed him his fellow priest, who, according
to his wont, was walking to and fro at the bottom of the
garden, reading his breviary, he ran up to him, tottering on
his short legs. He tried to speak and tell the other the sad
news, but his grief choked him, and he could only throw his
arms round Abbé Faujas's neck, while sobbing bitterly.</p>

<p>'Hullo! what's the matter with the two parsons?' cried
Mouret, who had hastily rushed out of the dining-room.</p>

<p>'The Curé of Saint-Saturnin's is dying,' Marthe replied,
showing much distress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Mouret assumed an expression of surprise, and, as he
went back into the house, he murmured:</p>

<p>'Pooh! that worthy Bourrette will manage to console
himself to-morrow when he is appointed Curé in the other's
place. He counts on getting the post; he told me so.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas disengaged himself from the old priest's
embrace, quietly closed his breviary, and listened to the sad
news with a grave face.</p>

<p>'Compan wants to see you,' said Abbé Bourrette in a
broken voice; 'he will not last the morning out. Oh! he has
been a dear friend to me! We studied together. He is
anxious to say good-bye to you. He has been telling me all
through the night that you were the only man of courage in
the diocese. For more than a year now he has been getting
weaker and weaker, and not a single Plassans priest has dared
to go and grasp his hand; while you, a stranger, who scarcely
knew him, you have spent an afternoon with him every week.
The tears came into his eyes just now as he was speaking of
you; you must lose no time, my friend.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas went up to his room for a moment, while
Abbé Bourrette paced impatiently and hopelessly about the
passage; and then at last they set off together. The old
priest wiped his brow and swayed about on the road as he
talked in disconnected fashion:</p>

<p>'He would have died like a dog without a single prayer
being said for him if his sister had not come and told me
about him at eleven o'clock last night. She did quite right,
the dear lady, though he did not want to compromise any of
us, and even would have foregone the last sacraments. Yes,
my friend, he was dying all alone, abandoned and deserted,
he who had so high a mind, and who has only lived to do
good!'</p>

<p>Then Bourrette became silent; but after a few moments
he resumed again in a different voice:</p>

<p>'Do you think that Fenil will ever forgive me for this?
Never, I expect! When Compan saw me bringing the
viaticum, he was unwilling to let me anoint him and told me to
go away. Well, well! it's all over with me now, and I shall
never be Curé! But I am glad that I did it, and that I
haven't let Compan die like a dog. He has been at war
with Fenil for thirty years, you know. When he took to his
bed he said to me, "Ah! it's Fenil who is going to carry the
day! Now that I am stricken down he will get the better of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
me!" So think of it! That poor Compan, whom I have
seen so high-spirited and energetic at Saint-Saturnin's!
Little Eusèbe, the choir-boy, whom I took to ring the viaticum
bell, was quite embarrassed when he found where we
were going. He kept looking behind him at each tinkle, as
if he was afraid that Fenil would hear it.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas, who was stepping along quickly with bent
head and a preoccupied air, kept perfectly silent, and did not
even seem to hear what his companion was saying.</p>

<p>'Has the Bishop been informed?' he suddenly asked.</p>

<p>But Abbé Bourrette in his turn now appeared to be buried
in thought and made no reply; however, just as they reached
Abbé Compan's door he said to his companion:</p>

<p>'Tell him that we met Fenil and that he bowed to us. It
will please him, for he will then think that I shall be appointed
Curé.'</p>

<p>They went up the stairs in silence. The Curé's sister
came to the landing, and on seeing them burst into tears.
Then she stammered between her sobs:</p>

<p>'It is all over! He has just passed away in my arms. I
was quite alone with him. As he was dying, he looked round
him and murmured, "I must have the plague since they have
all deserted me." Ah! gentlemen he died with his eyes full
of tears.'</p>

<p>They went into the little room where Abbé Compan, with
his head resting on his pillow, seemed to be asleep. His eyes
had remained open, and tears yet trickled down his white sad
face. Then Abbé Bourrette fell upon his knees, sobbing and
praying, with his face pressed to the counterpane. Abbé
Faujas at first remained standing, gazing at the dead man;
and after having knelt for a moment, he quietly went away.
Abbé Bourrette was so absorbed in his grief that he did not
even hear his colleague close the door.</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas went straight to the Bishop's. In Monseigneur
Rousselot's ante-chamber he met Abbé Surin, carrying
a bundle of papers.</p>

<p>'Do you want to speak to his lordship?' asked the
secretary, with his never-failing smile. 'You have come at
an unfortunate time. His lordship is so busy that he has
given orders that no one is to be admitted.'</p>

<p>'But I want to see him on a very urgent matter,' quietly
said Abbé Faujas. 'You can at any rate let him know that I
am here; and I will wait, if it is necessary.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>'I am afraid that it would be useless for you to wait.
His lordship has several people with him. It would be better
if you came again to-morrow.'</p>

<p>But the Abbé took a chair, and just as he was doing so the
Bishop opened the door of his study. He appeared much
vexed on seeing his visitor, whom at first he pretended not to
recognise.</p>

<p>'My son,' he said to Surin, 'when you have arranged those
papers, come to me immediately; there is a letter I want to
dictate to you.'</p>

<p>Then turning to the priest, who remained respectfully
standing, he said:</p>

<p>'Ah! is it you, Monsieur Faujas? I am very glad to see
you. Perhaps you want to say something to me? Come into
my study; you are never in the way.'</p>

<p>Monseigneur Rousselot's study was a very large and
rather gloomy room, in which a great wood fire was kept
burning in the summer as well as the winter. The heavy
carpet and curtains kept out all the air, and the room was like
a warm bath. The Bishop, like some dowager shutting herself
up from the world, detesting all noise and excitement,
lived a chilly life there in his armchair, committing to Abbé
Fenil the care of his diocese. He delighted in the classics,
and it was said that he was secretly making a translation of
Horace. He was equally fond of the little verses of the
Anthology, and broad quotations occasionally escaped from
his lips, quotations which he enjoyed with the naïveté of a
learned man who cares nothing for the modesty of the vulgar.</p>

<p>'There is no one here, you see,' said he, sitting down before
the fire; 'but I don't feel very well to-day, and I gave
orders that nobody was to be admitted. Now you can tell me
what you have to say; I am quite at your service.'</p>

<p>His general expression of amiability was tinged with a
kind of vague uneasiness, a sort of resigned submission.
When Abbé Faujas had informed him of the death of Abbé
Compan, he rose from his chair, apparently both distressed
and alarmed.</p>

<p>'What!' he cried, 'my good Compan dead! and I was not
able to bid him farewell! No one gave me any warning! Ah,
my friend, you were right when you gave me to understand
that I was no longer master here. They abuse my kindness.'</p>

<p>'Your lordship knows,' said Abbé Faujas, 'how devoted I
am to you. I am only waiting for a sign from you.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>The Bishop shook his head as he murmured:</p>

<p>'Yes, yes; I remember the offer you made to me. You
have an excellent heart; but what an uproar there would be,
if I were to break with Abbé Fenil! I should have my ears
deafened for a whole week! And yet if I could feel quite sure
that you could really rid me of him, if I was not afraid that
at a week's end he would come back and crush your neck
under his heel&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas could not repress a smile. Tears were welling
from the Bishop's eyes.</p>

<p>'Yes, I am afraid, I am afraid,' the prelate resumed, as he
again sank down into his chair. 'I don't feel equal to it yet.
It is that miserable man who has killed Compan and has
kept his death agony a secret from me so that I might not go
and close his eyes. He is capable of the most terrible things.
But, you see, I like to live in peace. Fenil is very energetic
and he renders me great services in the diocese. When I am
no longer here, matters will perhaps be better ordered.'</p>

<p>He grew calmer again and his smile returned.</p>

<p>'Besides, everything is going on satisfactorily at present,
and I don't see any immediate difficulty. We can wait.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas sat down, and calmly resumed:</p>

<p>'No doubt: but still you will have to appoint a Curé for
Saint-Saturnin's in succession to the Abbé Compan.'</p>

<p>Monseigneur Rousselot lifted his hands to his temples with
an expression of hopelessness.</p>

<p>'Indeed, you are right!' he ejaculated. 'I had forgotten
that. Poor Compan doesn't know in what a hole he has put
me, by dying so suddenly without my having had any warning.
I promised you that place, didn't I?'</p>

<p>The Abbé bowed.</p>

<p>'Well, my friend, you will save me by letting me take back
my word. You know how Fenil detests you. The success of
the Home of the Virgin has made him quite furious, and he
swears that he will prevent you from making the conquest
of Plassans. I am talking to you quite openly, you see.
Recently, when reference was made to the appointment of a
Curé for Saint-Saturnin's, I let your name fall. But Fenil
flew into a frightful rage and I was obliged to promise that I
would give the place to a friend of his, Abbé Chardon, whom
you know, and who is really a very worthy man. Now, my
friend, do this much for me, and give up that idea. I will
make you whatever recompense you like to name.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>The priest's face wore a grave expression. After a short
interval of silence during which he seemed to be taking
counsel of himself, he spoke:</p>

<p>'You know very well, my lord,' he said, 'that I am quite
without personal ambition. I should much prefer to lead a
life of privacy, and it would be a great relief to me to give up
this appointment. But I am not my own master, I feel
bound to satisfy those patrons of mine who take an interest
in me. I trust that your lordship will reflect very seriously
before taking a step which you would probably regret afterwards.'</p>

<p>Although Abbé Faujas spoke very humbly, the Bishop was
not unconscious of the menace which his words veiled. He
rose from his chair and took a few steps about the room, a
prey to the painful perplexity.</p>

<p>'Well, well,' he said, lifting his hands, 'here's trouble and
no mistake, for a long time. I should much have preferred
to avoid all these explanations, but, since you insist, I must
speak frankly. Well, my dear sir, Abbé Fenil brings many
charges against you. As I think I told you before, he must
have written to Besançon and learnt all the vexatious stories
you know of. You have certainly explained those matters to
me, and I am quite aware of your merits and of your life of
penitence and solitude; but what can I do? Fenil has weapons
against you and he uses them ruthlessly. I often don't know
what to say in your defence. When the Minister requested
me to receive you into my diocese, I did not conceal from him
that your position would be a difficult one; but he continued
to press me and said that that was your affair, and so in the
end I consented. But you must not come to-day and ask me
to do what is impossible.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas had not lowered his head during the Bishop's
remarks. He now raised it still higher as he looked the
prelate straight in the face and said in his sharp voice:</p>

<p>'You have given me your promise, my lord.'</p>

<p>'Certainly, certainly,' the Bishop replied. 'That poor
Compan was getting weaker every day and you came and confided
certain matters to me, and I then made the promise to
you. I don't deny it. Listen to me, I will tell you everything,
so that you may not accuse me of wheeling round like a
weathercock. You asserted that the Minister was extremely
desirous for you to be appointed Curé of Saint-Saturnin's.
Well, I wrote for information on the subject, and a friend of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
mine went to the Ministry in Paris. They almost laughed in
his face there, and they told him that they didn't even know
you. The Minister absolutely denies that he is your supporter,
do you hear? If you wish it, I will read you a letter in which
he makes some very stern remarks about you.'</p>

<p>He stretched his arm towards a drawer, but Abbé Faujas
rose to his feet without taking his eyes off him, and smiled
with mingled irony and pity.</p>

<p>'Ah, my lord! my lord!' said he.</p>

<p>Then, after a moment's silence, as though he were unwilling
to enter into further explanations, he said:</p>

<p>'I give your lordship back your promise; but believe that
in all this I was working more for your own advantage than
for mine. By-and-by, when it will be too late, you will call
my warnings to mind.'</p>

<p>He stepped towards the door, but the Bishop laid his hand
upon him and brought him back, saying with an expression
of uneasiness:</p>

<p>'What do you mean? Explain yourself, my dear Monsieur
Faujas. I know very well that I have not been in favour at
Paris since the election of the Marquis de Lagrifoul. But
people know me very little if they suppose that I had any
hand in the matter. I don't go out of my study twice a
month. Do you imagine that they accuse me of having
brought about the marquis's return?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I am afraid so,' the priest curtly replied.</p>

<p>'But it is quite absurd! I have never interfered in
politics; I live amongst my beloved books. It was Fenil who
did it all. I told him a score of times that he would end by
compromising me in Paris.'</p>

<p>He checked himself and blushed slightly at having allowed
these last words to escape him. Abbé Faujas sat down again
and said in a deep voice:</p>

<p>'My lord, by those words you have condemned your vicar-general.
I have never said otherwise than you have just said.
Do not continue to make common cause with him or he will
lead you into serious trouble. I have friends in Paris, whatever
you may believe. I know that the Marquis de Lagrifoul's
election has strongly predisposed the Government against
you. Rightly or wrongly, they believe that you are the sole
cause of the opposition movement which has manifested itself
in Plassans, where the Minister, for special reasons, is most
anxious to have a majority. If the Legitimist candidate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
should again succeed at the next election, it would be very
awkward, and I should be considerably alarmed for your
comfort.'</p>

<p>'But this is abominable!' cried the unhappy Bishop,
rocking himself in his chair; 'I can't prevent the Legitimist
candidate from being returned! I haven't got the least
influence, and I never mix myself up in these matters at all.
Really, there are times when I feel that I should like to shut
myself up in a monastery. I could take my books with me,
and lead a quiet, peaceful life there. It is Fenil who ought
to be Bishop instead of me. If I were to listen to Fenil, I
should get on the very worst terms with the Government. I
should hearken only to Rome, and tell Paris to mind its own
business. But that is not my nature, and I want to die in
peace. The Minister, then, you say, is enraged with me?'</p>

<p>The priest made no reply. Two creases which appeared
at the corners of his mouth gave his face an expression of
silent scorn.</p>

<p>'Really,' continued the Bishop, 'if I thought it would
please him if I were to appoint you Curé of Saint-Saturnin's,
I would try to manage it. But I can assure you that you are
mistaken. You are but little in the odour of sanctity.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas made a hasty movement of his hands, as he
broke out impatiently:</p>

<p>'Have you forgotten that calumnies are circulated about
me, and that I came to Plassans in a threadbare cassock?
When they send a compromised man to a post of danger, they
deny all knowledge of him till the day of triumph. Help me
to succeed, my lord, and then you will see that I have friends
in Paris.'</p>

<p>Then, as the Bishop, surprised to find in a priest such a
bold adventurer, continued to gaze at him in silence, Faujas
lapsed into a less assertive manner and continued:</p>

<p>'These, however, are suppositions, and what I mean is,
that I have much to be pardoned. My friends are waiting to
thank you till my position is completely established.'</p>

<p>Monseigneur Rousselot kept silence for a moment longer.
He was a man of sharp understanding, and he had gained a
knowledge of human failings from books. He was conscious
of his own yielding character, and he was even a little
ashamed of it; but he consoled himself for it by judging men
for what they were worth. In the life of a learned epicurean,
which he led, there were times when he felt supreme disdain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
for the ambitious men about him, who fought amongst themselves
for a few stray shreds of his power.</p>

<p>'Well,' he said, with a smile, 'you are a pertinacious man,
my dear Monsieur Faujas, and since I have made you a
promise I will keep it. Six months ago, I confess, I should
have been afraid of stirring up all Plassans against me, but
you have succeeded in making yourself liked, and the ladies
of the town often speak to me about you in very eulogistic
terms. In appointing you Curé of Saint-Saturnin's, I am
only paying the debt which we owe you for the Home of the
Virgin.'</p>

<p>The Bishop had recovered his usual pleasant amiability
and charming manner. Just at this moment Abbé Surin put
his handsome head through the doorway.</p>

<p>'No, my child,' said the Bishop to him, 'I shall not
dictate that letter to you. I have no further need of you, and
you can go.'</p>

<p>'Abbé Fenil is here,' muttered the young priest.</p>

<p>'Oh, very well, let him wait!'</p>

<p>Monseigneur Rousselot winced slightly; but he spoke to
his secretary with an almost ludicrous expression of decision,
and looked at Abbé Faujas with a glance of intelligence.</p>

<p>'See! go out this way,' he said to him, as he opened a
door that was hidden behind a curtain.</p>

<p>He kept the priest standing on the threshold for a moment,
and continued to look at him with a smile on his face.</p>

<p>'Fenil will be furious,' said he; 'but you will promise to
defend me against him if he is too hard upon me! I am
making him your enemy, I warn you of that. I am counting
upon you, too, to prevent the re-election of the Marquis de
Lagrifoul. Ah! it is upon you that I am leaning now, my
dear Monsieur Faujas.'</p>

<p>He waved his white hand to the Abbé, and then returned
with an appearance of perfect unconcern to the warmth of
his study. The priest had remained bowing, feeling surprised
at the quite feminine ease with which the Bishop changed
his master and yielded to the stronger side. And only now
did he begin to feel that Monseigneur Rousselot had been
secretly laughing at him, even as he laughed at Abbé Fenil
in that downy armchair of his where he read his Horace.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock on the following Thursday, just when
the fashionable folks of Plassans were treading on each
other's toes in the Rougons' green drawing-room, Abbé Faujas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
appeared at the door. He looked tall and majestic, there was
a bright colour on his cheeks, and he wore a delicate cassock
that glistened like satin. His face was still grave, though
there was a slight smile upon it, just the pleasant turn of the
lips that was necessary to light up his stern countenance with
a ray of cheerfulness.</p>

<p>'Ah! here is the dear Curé!' Madame de Condamin
gaily exclaimed.</p>

<p>The mistress of the house eagerly hastened up to him;
she grasped one of his hands within both her own, and drew
him into the middle of the room, with wheedling glances and
a gentle swaying of her head.</p>

<p>'This is a surprise! a very pleasant surprise!' she cried.
'It's an age since we have seen you! Is it only when good
fortune visits you that you can remember your friends?'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas bowed with easy composure. All around
him there was a flattering ovation, a buzzing of enthusiastic
women. Madame Delangre and Madame Rastoil did not
wait till he came up to them, but hastened to congratulate
him upon his appointment, which had been officially
announced that morning. The mayor, the justice of the
peace, and even Monsieur de Bourdeu, all stepped up to him
and shook his hand heartily.</p>

<p>'Ah, he's a fine fellow and will go a long way!' Monsieur
de Condamin murmured into Doctor Porquier's ear. 'I
scented him from the first day I saw him. That grimacing
old Madame Rougon and he tell no end of lies. I have seen
him slipping in here at dusk half a score of times. They
must be mixed up in some queer things together.'</p>

<p>Doctor Porquier was terribly afraid of being compromised
by Monsieur de Condamin, so he hurried away from him, and
came like the others to grasp Abbé Faujas's hand, although
he had never previously spoken to him.</p>

<p>The priest's triumphal entry was the great event of the
evening. He had now seated himself and was hemmed in by
a triple circle of petticoats. He talked with charming good
nature on all sorts of subjects, but avoided replying to any
hints or allusions. When Félicité directly questioned him,
he merely said that he should not occupy the parsonage, as he
preferred remaining in the lodgings where he had found himself
so comfortable for nearly three years. Marthe was present
among the other ladies, and was, as usual, extremely reserved.
She had only just smiled at the Abbé, watching him from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
distance, and looking the while a little pale and rather
weary and uneasy. When he signified his intention of not
quitting the Rue Balande, she blushed and rose to go into
the small drawing-room as if she felt incommoded by the
heat. Madame Paloque, beside whom Monsieur de Condamin
had seated himself, said to him quite loud enough to
be heard:</p>

<p>'It's very decorous, isn't it? She certainly might refrain
from making assignations with him here, since they have the
whole day to themselves!'</p>

<p>Only Monsieur de Condamin laughed; everyone else
received the sally very coldly. Then Madame Paloque,
recognising that she had made a mistake, tried to turn the
matter off as a joke. Meantime in the corners of the room
the guests were discussing Abbé Fenil. Great curiosity was
manifested as to whether he would put in an appearance.
Monsieur de Bourdeu, who was one of his friends, said with
an air of authority that he was indisposed&mdash;a statement
which was received by the company with discreet smiles.
Everyone was quite aware of the revolution that had taken
place at the Bishop's. Abbé Surin gave the ladies some very
interesting details of the terrible scene that had taken place
between his lordship and the grand-vicar. The latter, on
getting the worst of the struggle, had caused it to be reported
that he was confined to his room by an attack of gout. But
the fight was not over, and Abbé Surin hinted that a good
deal more would happen yet, a remark which was whispered
about the room with many little exclamations, shakings of
heads and expressions of surprise and doubt. For the moment,
at any rate, Abbé Faujas was carrying everything before him
and so the fair devotees sunned themselves pleasantly in the
rays of the rising luminary.</p>

<p>About the middle of the evening Abbé Bourrette arrived.
Conversation ceased and people looked at him with curiosity.
They all knew that he had expected to be appointed Curé of
Saint-Saturnin's himself. He had taken over the Abbé
Compan's duties during the latter's long illness, and he had a
lien upon the appointment. He lingered for a moment by
the door, a little out of breath and with blinking eyes, without
being aware of the interest which his appearance excited.
Then, catching sight of Abbé Faujas, he eagerly hastened up
to him, and seizing both his hands with a show of much
pleasure exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>'Ah! my dear friend, let me congratulate you! I have
just come from your rooms, where your mother told me that
you were here. I am delighted to see you.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas had risen from his seat, and notwithstanding
his great self-control, he seemed annoyed, taken by surprise,
as it were, by this unexpected display of affection.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he murmured, 'I felt bound to accept his lordship's
offer in spite of my lack of merit. I refused it, indeed, at
first, mentioning the names of several more deserving priests
than myself. I mentioned your own name.'</p>

<p>Abbé Bourrette blinked, and taking Abbé Faujas aside he
said to him in low tones:</p>

<p>'His lordship has told me all about it. Fenil, it seems,
would not hear of me. He would have set the whole diocese
in a blaze if I had been appointed. Those were his very
words. My crime is having closed poor Compan's eyes. He
demanded, as you know, the appointment of Abbé Chardon, a
pious man, no doubt, but not of sufficient reputation. Fenil
counted on reigning at Saint-Saturnin's in his name. It was
then that his lordship determined to give you the place and
checkmate him. I am quite avenged, and I am delighted, my
dear friend. Did you know the full story?'</p>

<p>'No, not in all its details.'</p>

<p>'Well, it is all just as I have told you, I can assure you.
I have the facts from his lordship's own lips. Between ourselves,
he has hinted to me of a very sufficient recompense.
The deputy vicar-general, Abbé Vial, has for a long time been
desirous of settling in Rome, and his place will be vacant, you
understand. But don't say anything about this. I wouldn't
take a big sum of money for my day's work.'</p>

<p>He continued pressing both Abbé Faujas's hands, while his
broad face beamed with satisfaction. The ladies around them
were smiling and looking at them in surprise. But the worthy
man's joy was so frank and unreserved that it communicated
itself to all in the green drawing-room, where the ovation in
the new Curé's honour took a more familiar and affectionate
turn. The ladies grouped themselves together and spoke of
the cathedral organ which wanted repairing, and Madame de
Condamin promised a magnificent altar for the procession on
the approaching festival of Corpus Christi.</p>

<p>Abbé Bourrette was sharing in the general triumph when
Madame Paloque, craning out her hideous face, touched him
on the shoulder and murmured in his ear:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>'Your reverence won't, I suppose, hear confessions to-morrow
in Saint-Michael's chapel?'</p>

<p>The priest, while taking Abbé Compan's duty, had occupied
the confessional in Saint-Michael's chapel, which was the
largest and most convenient in the church and was specially
reserved for the Curé. He did not at first understand the
force of Madame Paloque's remark, and he looked at her,
again blinking his eyes.</p>

<p>'I ask you,' she continued, 'if you will resume your old
confessional in the chapel of the Holy Angels, to-morrow.'</p>

<p>He turned rather pale and remained silent for a moment
longer. Then he bent his gaze to the floor, and a slight
shiver coursed down his neck, as though he had received a
blow from behind. And, seeing that Madame Paloque was
still there staring at him, he stammered out:</p>

<p>'Certainly; I shall go back to my old confessional. Come
to the chapel of the Holy Angels, the last one on the left, on
the same side as the cloisters. It is very damp, so wrap
yourself up well, dear madame, wrap yourself up well.'</p>

<p>Tears rose to his eyes. He was filled with regretful
longing for that handsome confessional in the chapel of Saint-Michael,
into which the warm sun streamed in the afternoon
just at the time when he heard confessions. Until now he
had felt no sorrow at relinquishing the cathedral to Abbé
Faujas; but this little matter, this removal from one chapel
to another, affected him very painfully; and it seemed to him
that he had missed the goal of his life. Madame Paloque
told him in her loud voice that he appeared to have grown
melancholy all at once, but he protested against this assertion
and tried to smile and look cheerful again. However he left
the drawing-room early in the evening.</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas was one of the last to go. Rougon came up
to him to offer his congratulations and they remained talking
earnestly together on a couch. They spoke of the necessity of
religious feeling in a wisely ordered state. Each lady, on
retiring from the room, made a low bow as she passed in
front of them.</p>

<p>'You know, Monsieur le Curé,' said Félicité graciously,
'that you are my daughter's cavalier.'</p>

<p>The priest rose from his seat. Marthe was waiting for
him at the door. When they got out into the street, they
seemed as if blinded by the darkness, and crossed the Place of
the Sub-Prefecture without exchanging a word; but in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Rue Balande, as they stood in front of the house, Marthe
touched the priest's arm at the moment when he was about
to insert the key in the lock.</p>

<p>'I am so very pleased at your success,' she said to him,
in a tone of great emotion. 'Be kind to me to-day, and
grant me the favour which you have hitherto refused. I
assure you that Abbé Bourrette does not understand me. It
is only you who can direct and save me.'</p>

<p>He motioned her away from him, and, when he had opened
the door and lighted the little lamp which Rose had left at the
foot of the staircase, he went upstairs, saying to her gently
as he did so:</p>

<p>'You promised me to be reasonable&mdash;well, I will think
over what you have asked. We will talk about it.'</p>

<p>Marthe did not retire to her own room until she had heard
the priest close his door on the upper floor. While she was
undressing and getting into bed she paid no attention whatever
to Mouret, who, half asleep, was retailing to her at great
length some gossip that was being circulated in the town. He
had been to his club, the Commercial Club, a place where he
rarely set foot.</p>

<p>'Abbé Faujas has got the better of Abbé Bourrette,' he
repeated for the tenth time as he slowly rolled his head upon
the pillow. 'Poor Abbé Bourrette! Well, never mind! it's
good fun to see those parsons devouring one another. The
other day when they were hugging each other in the garden&mdash;you
remember it, don't you?&mdash;anyone would have thought
that they were brothers. Ah! they rob each other even of
their very penitents. But why don't you say anything, my
dear? You don't agree with me, eh? Or is it because you
are going to sleep? Well, well, good-night then, my dear.'</p>

<p>He fell asleep, still muttering disjointed words, while
Marthe, with widely opened eyes, stared up into the air and
followed over the ceiling, faintly illumined by the night-light,
the pattering of the Abbé's slippers while he was retiring to
rest.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="XII" id="XII">XII</a></h3>

<p>At the return of summer Abbé Faujas and his mother again
came downstairs to enjoy the fresh air on the terrace. Mouret
had become very cross-grained. He declined the old lady's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
invitations to play piquet and sat swaying himself about on a
chair. Seeing him yawn, without making any attempt to
conceal how bored he was feeling, Marthe said to him:</p>

<p>'Why don't you go to your club, my dear?'</p>

<p>He now went there more frequently than he had been used
to do. When he returned he found his wife and the Abbé
still in the same place on the terrace, while Madame Faujas,
a few yards away from them, preserved the demeanour of a
blind and dumb guardian.</p>

<p>When anyone in the town spoke to Mouret of the new
Curé he still continued to sound his praises. Faujas, said
he, was decidedly a superior sort of man, and he himself had
never felt any doubt of his great abilities. Madame Paloque
could never succeed in drawing a hostile word from him on
the subject of the priest, in spite of the malicious way in
which she would ask him after his wife in the midst of his
remarks about Abbé Faujas. Old Madame Rougon had no
better success in her attempts to unveil the secret troubles
which she thought she could detect beneath Mouret's outward
show of cheerfulness. She laid all sorts of traps for him as
she watched his face with her sharp shrewd smile; but that
inveterate chatterer, whose tongue was a regular town-crier's
bell, now showed the greatest reserve when any reference was
made to his household.</p>

<p>'So your husband has become reasonable at last?' Félicité
remarked to her daughter one day. 'He leaves you free.'</p>

<p>Marthe looked at her mother with an air of surprise.</p>

<p>'I have always been free,' she said.</p>

<p>'Ah! my dear child, I see that you don't want to say
anything against him. You told me once that he looked very
unfavourably upon Abbé Faujas.'</p>

<p>'Nothing of the kind, I assure you! You must have
imagined it. My husband is upon the best terms with Abbé
Faujas. There is nothing whatever to make them otherwise.'</p>

<p>Marthe was much astonished at the persistence with which
everybody seemed to imagine that her husband and the Abbé
were not good friends. Frequently at the committee-meetings
at the Home of the Virgin the ladies put questions to her
which made her quite impatient. She was really very happy
and contented, and the house in the Rue Balande had never
seemed pleasanter to her than it did now. Abbé Faujas had
given her to understand that he would undertake her spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
direction as soon as he should be of opinion that Abbé Bourrette
was no longer sufficient, and she lived in this hope, her
mind full of simple joy, like a girl who is promised some
pretty religious pictures if she keeps good. Every now and
then indeed she felt as though she were becoming a child
again; she experienced a freshness of feeling and child-like
impulses that filled her with gentle emotion. One day, in
the spring-time, as Mouret was pruning his tall box plants,
he found her sitting at the bottom of the garden beneath the
young shoots of the arbour with her eyes streaming with
tears.</p>

<p>'What is the matter, my dear?' he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>'Nothing,' she said, with a smile, 'nothing at all, really;
I am very happy, very.'</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and went on delicately cutting
the box plants into an even line. He took considerable pride
in having the neatest trimmed hedges in the neighbourhood.
Marthe had wiped her eyes, but she soon began to weep again,
feeling a choking heart-rending sensation at the scent of the
severed verdure. She was forty years old now, and it was for
her past-away youth that she was weeping.</p>

<p>Since his appointment as Curé of Saint-Saturnin's, Abbé
Faujas had shown a dignity which seemed to increase his
stature. He carried his breviary and his hat with an air
of authority, which he had exhibited at the cathedral
in such wise as to ensure himself the respect of the clergy.
Abbé Fenil, having sustained another defeat on two or three
matters of detail, now seemed to have left his adversary free
to do as he pleased. Abbé Faujas, however, was not foolish
enough to make any indiscreet use of his triumph, but showed
himself extremely supple. He was quite conscious that
Plassans was still far from being his; and so, though he
stopped every now and then in the street to shake hands with
Monsieur Delangre, he merely exchanged passing salutations
with Monsieur de Bourdeu, Monsieur Maffre, and the other
guests of Monsieur Rastoil. A large section of society in the
town still looked upon him with suspicion. They found fault
with him for the want of frankness in his political opinions.
In their estimation he ought to explain himself, declare himself
in favour of one party or another. But the Abbé only
smiled and said that he belonged to 'the honest men's party,'
a reply which spared him a more explicit declaration. Moreover
he showed no haste or anxiety, but continued to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
aloof till the drawing-rooms should open their doors to him of
their own accord.</p>

<p>'No, my friend, not now; later on we will see about it,'
he said to Abbé Bourrette, who had been pressing him to pay
a visit to Monsieur Rastoil.</p>

<p>He was known to have refused two invitations to the Sub-Prefecture,
and the Mourets were still the only people with
whom he continued intimate. There he was, as it were, occupying
a post of observation between two hostile camps. On
Tuesdays, when the two sets of guests assembled in the
gardens on his right and left, he took up his position at his
window and watched the sunset in the distance behind the
forests of the Seille, and then, before withdrawing, he lowered
his eyes and replied with as much amiability to the bows of
Monsieur Rastoil's guests as to those of the Sub-Prefect's.
His intercourse with his neighbours as yet went no further
than this.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, however, he went down into the garden. He
was quite at home now in Mouret's grounds and no longer
confined himself to pacing up and down beneath the arbour
as he read his breviary. All the walks and beds seemed to
belong to him; his cassock glided blackly past all the greenery.
On that particular Tuesday, as he made a tour of the garden,
he caught sight of Monsieur Maffre and Madame Rastoil
below him and bowed to them; and then as he passed below
the terrace of the Sub-Prefecture, he saw Monsieur de Condamin
leaning there in company with Doctor Porquier. After
an exchange of salutations, the priest was turning along the
path, when the doctor called to him.</p>

<p>'Just a word, your reverence, I beg.'</p>

<p>Then he asked him at what time he could see him the
following day. This was the first occasion on which any
one of the two sets of guests had spoken to the priest from
one garden to the other. The doctor was in great trouble
however. His scamp of a son had been caught in a
gambling den behind the gaol in company with other
worthless characters. The most distressing part of the matter
was that Guillaume was accused of being the leader of the
band, and of having led Monsieur Maffre's sons, much
younger than himself, astray.</p>

<p>'Pooh!' said Monsieur de Condamin with his sceptical
laugh; 'young men must sow their wild oats. What a fuss
about nothing! Here's the whole town in a state of perturbation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
because some young fellows have been caught
playing baccarat and there happened to be a lady with them!'</p>

<p>The doctor seemed very much shocked at this.</p>

<p>'I want to ask your advice,' he said, addressing himself to
the priest. 'Monsieur Maffre came to my house boiling over
with anger, and assailed me with the bitterest reproaches,
crying out that it was all my fault, as I had brought my son
up badly. I am extremely distressed and troubled about it.
Monsieur Maffre ought to know me better. I have sixty years
of stainless life behind me.'</p>

<p>He went on wailing, dwelling upon the sacrifices that he
had made for his son and expressing his fears that he would
lose his practice in consequence of the young man's misconduct.
Abbé Faujas, standing in the middle of the path, raised
his head and gravely listened.</p>

<p>'I shall be only too glad if I can be of any service to you,'
he said kindly. 'I will see Monsieur Maffre and will let him
understand that his natural indignation has carried him too
far. I will go at once and ask him to appoint a meeting with
me for to-morrow. He is over there, on the other side.'</p>

<p>The Abbé crossed the garden and went towards Monsieur
Maffre, who was still there with Madame Rastoil. When the
justice of the peace found that the priest desired an interview
with him, he would not hear of his taking any trouble about
it, but put himself at his disposition, saying that he would do
himself the honour of calling upon him the next day.</p>

<p>'Ah! Monsieur le Curé,' Madame Rastoil then remarked,
'let me compliment you upon your sermon last Sunday. All
the ladies were much affected by it, I assure you.'</p>

<p>The Abbé bowed and crossed the garden again in order to
reassure Doctor Porquier. Then he continued slowly pacing
about the walks till nightfall, without taking part in any
further conversations, but ever hearing the merriment of the
groups of guests on his right hand and his left.</p>

<p>When Monsieur Maffre appeared the next day, Abbé Faujas
was watching a couple of men who were at work repairing the
fountain in the garden. He had expressed a desire to see the
fountain play again, for the empty basin, said he, had such a
melancholy appearance. At first Mouret had not seemed
very willing to have anything done, alleging the probability
of accidents with Désirée, but Marthe had prevailed upon him
to let the repairs be executed upon the understanding that
the basin should be protected by a railing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>'Monsieur le Curé,' said Rose, 'the justice of the peace
wishes to see you.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas hastened indoors. He wanted to take Monsieur
Maffre up to his own room on the second floor, but Rose
had already opened the drawing-room door.</p>

<p>'Go in,' she said; 'aren't you at home here? It is useless
to make the justice go up two flights of stairs. If you
had only told me this morning, I would have given the room
a dusting.'</p>

<p>As she closed the door upon the Abbé and the magistrate,
after opening the shutters, Mouret called her into the dining-room.</p>

<p>'That's right, Rose,' he cried, 'you had better give my
dinner to your priest this evening, and if he hasn't got sufficient
blankets of his own upstairs you can take mine off my
bed.'</p>

<p>The cook exchanged a meaning glance with Marthe, who
was working by the window, waiting till the sunshine should
leave the terrace. Then, shrugging her shoulders, she said:</p>

<p>'Ah! sir, you have never had a charitable heart!'</p>

<p>She took herself off, while Marthe continued sewing without
raising her head. For the last few days she had, with
feverish energy, again applied herself to her needlework. She
was embroidering an altar-frontal as a gift for the cathedral.
The ladies were desirous of giving a complete set of altar furniture.
Madame Rastoil and Madame Delangre had undertaken
to present the candlesticks, and Madame de Condamin had
ordered a magnificent silver crucifix from Paris.</p>

<p>Meantime, in the drawing-room, Abbé Faujas was gently
remonstrating with Monsieur Maffre, telling him that Doctor
Porquier was a religious man and a person of the highest
integrity, and that no one could be more pained than he by
his son's deplorable conduct. The magistrate listened with a
sanctimonious air, and his heavy features and big prominent
eyes assumed quite an ecstatic expression at certain pious
remarks which the priest uttered in a very moving manner.
He allowed that he had been rather too hasty, and declared
that he was willing to make every apology as his reverence
thought he had been in the wrong.</p>

<p>'You must send your own sons to me,' said the priest,
'and I will talk to them.'</p>

<p>Monsieur Maffre shook his head with a slight sneering
laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh! you needn't be afraid about them, Monsieur le Curé.
The young scamps won't play any more tricks. They have
been locked up in their rooms for the last three days with
nothing but bread and water. If I had had a stick in my
hand when I found out what they had been doing, I should
have broken it across their backs.'</p>

<p>The Abbé looked at him and recollected how Mouret had
accused him of having killed his wife by harshness and
avarice; then, with a gesture of protest, he added:</p>

<p>'No, no; that is not the way to treat young men. Your
elder son, Ambroise, is twenty years old and the younger
is nearly eighteen, isn't he? They are no longer children,
remember. You must allow them some amusements.'</p>

<p>The magistrate remained silent with surprise.</p>

<p>'Then you would let them go on smoking and allow them
to frequent cafés?' he said, presently.</p>

<p>'Well,' replied the priest, with a smile. 'I think that
young men should be allowed to meet together to talk and
smoke their cigarettes and even to play a game of billiards or
chess. They will give themselves every license if you show
no tolerance. Only remember that it is not to every café that
I should be willing for them to go. I should like to see a
special one provided for them, a sort of club, as I have seen
done in several towns.'</p>

<p>Then he unfolded a complete scheme for such a club.
Monsieur Maffre gradually seemed to appreciate it. He
nodded his head as he said:</p>

<p>'Capital, capital! It would be a worthy pendant to the
Home of the Virgin. Really, Monsieur le Curé, we must put
such a splendid idea as this into execution.'</p>

<p>'Well, then,' the priest concluded, as he accompanied Monsieur
Maffre to the door, 'since you approve of the plan, just
advocate it among your friends. I will see Monsieur Delangre,
and speak to him about it. We might meet in the cathedral
on Sunday after vespers and come to some decision.'</p>

<p>On the Sunday, Monsieur Maffre brought Monsieur Rastoil
with him. They found Abbé Faujas and Monsieur Delangre
in a little room adjoining the sacristy. The gentlemen displayed
great enthusiasm in favour of the priest's idea, and the
institution of a young men's club was agreed upon in principle.
There was considerable discussion, however, as to
what it should be called. Monsieur Maffre was strongly
desirous that it should be known as the Guild of Jesus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh, no! no!' the priest impatiently cried at last. 'You
would get scarcely anyone to join, and the few members
would only be jeered at. There must be no attempt to tack
religion on to the business; indeed, I intend that we should
leave religion outside its doors altogether. All we want to do
is to win the young people over to our side by providing them
with some innocent recreation; that is all.'</p>

<p>The justice of the peace gazed at the priest with such
an expression of astonishment and anxiety that Monsieur
Delangre was obliged to bend his head to conceal a smile,
while he slyly pulled the Abbé's cassock. Then the priest
went on in a calmer voice:</p>

<p>'I am sure, gentlemen, that you do not feel any distrust
of me, and I ask you to leave the management of the matter
in my hands. I propose to adopt some very simple name,
such a one, for instance, as the Young Men's Club, which
fully expresses all that is required.'</p>

<p>Monsieur Rastoil and Monsieur Maffre bowed, although
this title seemed to them a little weak. They next spoke of
nominating the Curé as president of a provisional committee.</p>

<p>'I fancy,' said Monsieur Delangre, glancing at the priest,
'that this suggestion will scarcely meet with his reverence's
approbation.'</p>

<p>'Oh dear, no!' the Abbé exclaimed, slightly shrugging his
shoulders. 'My cassock would frighten the timid and lukewarm
away. We should only get the pious young people, and
it is not for them that we are going to found our club. What
we want is to gather in the wanderers; to win converts, in a
word; isn't that so?'</p>

<p>'Clearly,' replied the presiding judge.</p>

<p>'Very well, then, it will be better for us to keep ourselves
in the background, myself especially. What I propose is this:
your son, Monsieur Rastoil, and yours, Monsieur Delangre,
will alone come forward. It must appear as if they themselves
had formed the idea of this club. Send them to me in
the morning, and I will talk the matter over at length with
them. I already have a suitable building in my mind and
a code of rules quite prepared. Your two sons, Monsieur
Maffre, will naturally be enrolled at the head of the list of
members.'</p>

<p>The presiding judge seemed flattered at the part assigned
to his son; and so matters were arranged in this way, notwithstanding
the resistance of the justice of the peace, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
had hoped to win some personal distinction from the founding
of the club. The next day Séverin Rastoil and Lucien
Delangre put themselves in communication with Abbé Faujas.
Séverin was a tall young man of five-and-twenty, with a badly
shaped skull and a dull brain, who had just been called to the
bar, thanks to the position which his father held. The latter
was anxiously dreaming of making him a public prosecutor's
assessor, despairing of his ever succeeding in winning any
practice for himself. Lucien, on the other hand, was short
and sharp-eyed, had a crafty mind, and pleaded with all the
coolness of an old practitioner, although he was a year
younger than Séverin. The 'Plassans Gazette' spoke of him
as a future light of the bar. It was more particularly to him
that the Abbé gave the minutest instructions as to his scheme.
As for young Rastoil he simply went fussing about, bursting
with importance. In three weeks the Young Men's Club was
founded and opened.</p>

<p>There was at that time beneath the church of the Minimes,
situated at the end of the Cours Sauvaire, a number of very
large rooms and an old monastery refectory, which were no
longer put to any use. This was the place that Abbé Faujas
had thought of for the club, and the clergy of the parish very
willingly allowed him to use the rooms. One morning, when
the provisional committee of the Young Men's Club had set
workmen going in this cellar-like place, the citizens of
Plassans were quite astounded to see what appeared to be a
café being fitted up under the church. Five days afterwards
there was no longer any room for doubt on the point. The
place was certainly going to be a café. Divans were being
brought thither, with marble-topped tables, chairs, two billiard-tables,
and even three crates of crockery and glass. An
entrance was contrived at the end of the building, as far as
possible from the doorway of the church, and great crimson
curtains, genuine restaurant-curtains, were hung behind the
glass panes. You descended five stone steps, and on opening
the door found yourself in a large hall; to the right of which
there was a smaller one and a reading-room, while in a
square room at the far end were placed the two billiard-tables.
They were exactly beneath the high altar.</p>

<p>'Well, my poor boys,' said Guillaume Porquier one day to
Monsieur Maffre's two sons, whom he had met on the Cours,
'so they are going to make you serve at mass between your
games at bézique.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>However, Ambroise and Alphonse besought him not to
speak to them in public, as their father had threatened to
send them to sea if they continued to associate with him.</p>

<p>When the first astonishment was over, the Young Men's
Club proved a great success. Monseigneur Rousselot accepted
the honorary presidency, and even visited it in person one
evening, attended by his secretary, Abbé Surin. Each of
them drank a glass of currant-syrup in the smaller room, and
the glass which his lordship used was preserved with great
respect upon a sideboard. The Bishop's visit is still talked of
with much emotion at Plassans, and it brought about the
adherence of all the fashionable young men of the town. It
was soon considered very bad style not to belong to the
Young Men's Club.</p>

<p>Guillaume Porquier, however, used to prowl about the
entrance, sniggering like a young wolf who dreams of making
his way into a sheep-fold. Notwithstanding all the fear they
had of their father, Monsieur Maffre's sons quite worshipped
this shameless young man who regaled them with stories of
Paris, and entertained them at secret little parties in the
suburbs. They had got into the habit of meeting him regularly
every Saturday evening at nine o'clock near a certain
seat on the Mall. They slipped away from the club and sat
gossiping till eleven, concealed beneath the dark shade of the
plane-trees. On these occasions Guillaume always twitted
them about the evenings they spent underneath the church
of the Minimes.</p>

<p>'It is very kind of you,' he, would say, 'to let yourselves
be led by the nose. The verger gives you glasses of sugar
and water as though he were administering the communion
to you, doesn't he?'</p>

<p>'Nothing of the sort! you are quite mistaken, I assure
you,' Ambroise exclaimed. 'You might fancy you were in
the Café du Cours, or the Café de France, or the Café des
Voyageurs. We drink beer, or punch, or madeira, whatever
we like, whatever is drunk in other places.'</p>

<p>Guillaume continued jeering however.</p>

<p>'Well, I shouldn't like to go drinking their dirty stuff,' he
said. 'I should be afraid that they had mixed some drug
with it to make me go to confession. I suppose you amuse
yourselves by playing at hot-cockles and puss-in-the-corner!'</p>

<p>The young Maffres gaily laughed at his pleasantries, but
they took care to undeceive him. They told him that even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
cards were allowed, and that there was no flavour of a church
about the place at all. The club was extremely pleasant,
there were very comfortable couches, and mirrors all over.</p>

<p>'Well,' said Guillaume, 'you'll never make me believe
that you can't hear the organ when there is an evening
service at the church. It would make me swallow my coffee
the wrong way only to know that there was a baptism, or a
marriage, or a funeral going on over my cup.'</p>

<p>'Well, there's something in that,' Alphonse allowed.
'Only the other day, while I was playing at billiards with
Séverin in the day-time, we could distinctly hear a funeral
going on. It was the funeral of the butcher's little girl, the
butcher at the corner of the Rue de la Banne. That fellow
Séverin is a big jackass, he tried to frighten me by telling me
that the whole funeral would fall through on our heads.'</p>

<p>'Ah well! it must be a very pleasant place, that club of
yours!' cried Guillaume. 'I wouldn't set foot in it for all
the money in the world! I'd as soon go and drink my coffee
in a sacristy.'</p>

<p>The truth of the matter was that Guillaume felt very
much vexed that he did not belong to the Young Men's Club.
His father had forbidden him to offer himself for election,
fearing that he would be rejected. At last, however, the young
man grew so annoyed about the matter that he sent in an
application to be allowed to join the club, without mentioning
what he had done to his people. The question was a very
serious one. The committee which elected the members then
comprised the young Maffres amongst its number, and Lucien
Delangre was its president and Séverin Rastoil its secretary.
These young men felt terribly embarrassed. While they did
not dare to grant Guillaume's application, they were unwilling
to do anything to hurt the feelings of Doctor Porquier, so
worthy and irreproachable a person, one, too, who was so completely
trusted by all the fashionable ladies. At last Ambroise
and Alphonse begged Guillaume not to press his application,
giving him to understand that he had no chance of being
admitted.</p>

<p>'You are a couple of pitiful poltroons!' he replied to them.
'Do you suppose that I care a fig about joining your brotherhood?
I was only amusing myself. I wanted to see if you
would have the courage to vote against me. I shall have a
good laugh when those hypocrites bang the door in my face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
As for you, my good little boys, you can go and amuse yourselves
where you like; I shall never speak to you again.'</p>

<p>The young Maffres, in great consternation, then besought
Lucien Delangre to try to arrange matters in such a way as
would prevent any unpleasantness. Lucien submitted the
difficulty to his usual adviser, Abbé Faujas, for whom he had
conceived a genuine disciple's admiration. The Abbé came
to the Young Men's Club every afternoon from five o'clock
till six. He walked through the big room with a pleasant
smile, nodding and sometimes stopping for a few minutes at
one of the tables to chat with some of the young men. However,
he never accepted anything to drink, not even a glass of
water. Afterwards he passed into the reading-room, and,
taking a seat at the long table covered with a green cloth,
he attentively pored over the newspapers which the club
received, the Legitimist organs of Paris and the neighbouring
departments. Occasionally he made a rapid note in a little
pocket-book. Then he went quietly away, again smiling at
the members who were present, and shaking hands with them.
On some occasions, however, he remained for a longer time
to watch a game at chess, or chat merrily about all kinds of
matters. The young men, who were extremely fond of him,
used to say that when he talked no one would take him for a
priest.</p>

<p>When the mayor's son told him of the embarrassment
which Guillaume's application had caused the committee,
Abbé Faujas promised to arrange the affair; and next morning
he went to see Doctor Porquier, to whom he related
everything. The doctor was aghast. His son, he cried, was
determined to kill him with distress by dishonouring his grey
hairs. What could be done now? Even if the application
were withdrawn, the shame and disgrace would be none the
less. The priest then advised him to send Guillaume away
for two or three months to an estate which he possessed a
few leagues from Plassans, and undertook to charge himself
with the further conduct of the affair. As soon as Guillaume
had left the town, the committee postponed the consideration
of his application, saying that there was no occasion for haste
in the matter, as the applicant was absent and that a decision
could be taken later on.</p>

<p>Doctor Porquier heard of this solution from Lucien
Delangre one afternoon when he was in the garden of the
Sub-Prefecture. He immediately hastened to the terrace. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
was the hour when Abbé Faujas read his breviary. Doctor
Porquier caught sight of him under the Mourets' arbour.</p>

<p>'Ah, Monsieur le Curé!' he cried, 'how can I thank you?
I should like very much to shake hands with you.'</p>

<p>'The wall is rather high,' said the priest, looking at it
with a smile.</p>

<p>But Doctor Porquier was an effusive individual who did
not allow himself to be discouraged by obstacles.</p>

<p>'Wait a moment!' he cried. 'If you will allow me,
Monsieur le Curé, I will come round.'</p>

<p>Then he disappeared. The Abbé, still smiling, slowly
bent his steps towards the little door which opened into the
Impasse des Chevillottes. The doctor was already gently
knocking at it.</p>

<p>'Ah! this door is nailed up,' said the priest. 'One of
the nails is broken though. If I had any sort of a tool, there
would be no difficulty in getting the other one out.'</p>

<p>He glanced round him and caught sight of a spade. Then,
after he had drawn back the bolts with a slight effort, he
opened the door, and stepped out into the alley, where Doctor
Porquier overwhelmed him with thanks and compliments. As
they walked along, talking, Monsieur Maffre, who happened
at the time to be in Monsieur Rastoil's garden, opened a little
door that was hidden away behind the presiding judge's
waterfall. The gentlemen were much amused to find themselves
all three in this deserted little lane.</p>

<p>They remained there for a few moments, and, as they
took leave of the Abbé, the magistrate and the doctor poked
their heads inside the Mourets' garden, looking about them
with curiosity.</p>

<p>Mouret, however, who was putting stakes to his tomatoes,
raised his head and caught sight of them. He was fairly
lost in astonishment.</p>

<p>'Hallo! so they've made their way in here!' he muttered.
'The Curé now only has to bring in both gangs!'</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="XIII" id="XIII">XIII</a></h3>


<p>Serge was now nineteen years of age. He occupied a small
room on the second floor, opposite the priest's, and there led
an almost cloistered life, spending much time in reading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>'I shall have to throw those old books of yours into the
fire,' Mouret said to him angrily. 'You'll end by making
yourself ill and having to take to your bed.'</p>

<p>The young man was, indeed, of such a nervous temperament,
that the slightest imprudence made him poorly, as
though he were a young girl, and thus he was frequently
confined to his room for two or three days together. At these
times Rose inundated him with herb tea, and whenever
Mouret went upstairs to shake him up a little, as he called it,
the cook, if she happened to be there, would turn her master
out of the room, crying out at him:</p>

<p>'Leave the poor dear alone! Can't you see that you are
killing him with your rough ways? It isn't after you that he
takes: he is the very image of his mother; and you'll never
be able to understand either the one or the other of them.'</p>

<p>Serge smiled. After he had left college his father, seeing
him so delicate, had hesitated to send him to Paris to read
for the bar there. He would not hear, however, of a provincial
faculty; Paris, he felt sure, was necessary for a young
man who wanted to climb to a high position. He tried,
indeed, to instil ambitious ideas into the lad, telling him that
many with much weaker wits than his own, his cousins, the
Rougons, for instance, had attained to great distinction.
Every time that the young man seemed to grow more robust,
his father settled that he should leave home early the following
month; but his trunk was never packed, for Serge was
always catching a fresh cold, and then his departure would be
again postponed.</p>

<p>On each of these occasions Marthe contented herself with
saying in her gentle, indifferent way:</p>

<p>'He isn't twenty yet. It's really not prudent to send so
young a lad to Paris; and, besides, he isn't wasting his time
here; you even think that he studies too much.'</p>

<p>Serge used to accompany his mother to mass. He was
very piously minded, very gentle and grave. Doctor Porquier
had recommended him to take a good deal of exercise, and he
had become enthusiastically fond of botany, going off on long
rambles to collect specimens which he spent his afternoons in
drying, mounting, classifying and naming. It was about this
time that he struck up a great friendship with Abbé Faujas.
The Abbé himself had botanised in earlier days, and he gave
Serge much practical advice for which the young man was
very grateful. They also lent each other books, and one day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
they went off together to try to discover a certain plant which
the priest said he thought would be found in the neighbourhood.
When Serge was ill, his neighbour came to see him
every morning, and sat and talked for a long while at his
bedside. At other times, when the young man was well, it
was he who went and knocked at Abbé Faujas's door, as soon
as he heard him stirring in his room. They were only
separated by a narrow landing, and they ended by almost
living together.</p>

<p>In spite of Marthe's unruffled tranquillity and Rose's
angry glances, Mouret still often indulged in bursts of anger.</p>

<p>'What can the young scamp be after up there?' he would
growl. 'Whole days pass without my catching more than a
glimpse of him. He never seems to stir from the Abbé; they
are always talking together in some corner or other. He shall
be off to Paris at once. He's as strong as a Turk. All those
ailments of his are mere shams, excuses to get himself petted
and coddled. You needn't both of you look at me in that
way; I don't mean to let the priest make a hypocrite of the
boy.'</p>

<p>Then he began to keep a watch over his son, and when he
thought that he was in Faujas's room he called for him
angrily.</p>

<p>'I would rather he went to the bad!' he cried one day in
a fit of rage.</p>

<p>'Oh, sir!' said Rose, 'it is abominable to say such
things.'</p>

<p>'Well, indeed I would! And I'll put him in the way
myself one of these days, if you irritate me much more with
these parsons of yours!'</p>

<p>Serge naturally joined the Young Men's Club, though he
went there but little, preferring the solitude of his own room.
If it had not been for Abbé Faujas, whom he sometimes met
there, he would probably never have set foot in the place.
The Abbé taught him to play chess in the reading-room.
Mouret, on learning that the lad met the priest at the café,
swore that he would pack him off by the train on the following
Monday. His luggage was indeed got ready, and quite
seriously this time, but Serge, who had gone out to spend a
last day in the open country, returned home drenched to the
skin by a sudden downpour of rain. He was obliged to go to
bed, shivering with fever. For three weeks he hung between
life and death; and then his convalescence lasted for two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
long months. At the beginning of it he was so weak that he
lay with his head on the pillow and his arms stretched over
the sheets, as motionless as if he were simply a wax figure.</p>

<p>'It is your fault, sir!' cried the cook to Mouret. 'You
will have it on your conscience if the boy dies.'</p>

<p>While his son continued in danger, Mouret wandered
silently about the house, plunged in gloomy melancholy, his
eyes red with crying. He seldom went upstairs, but paced
up and down the passage to intercept the doctor as he went
away. When he was told that Serge was at length out of
danger, he glided quietly into the lad's room and offered his
help. But Rose turned him away. They had no occasion
for him, she said, and the boy was not yet strong enough to
bear his roughness. He had much better go and attend to
his business instead of getting in the way there. Mouret
then remained in complete loneliness downstairs, more
melancholy and unoccupied than ever. He felt no inclination
for anything, said he. As he went along the passage, he
often heard on the second floor the voice of Abbé Faujas, who
spent whole afternoons by Serge's bedside, now that he was
growing better.</p>

<p>'How is he to-day, Monsieur l'Abbé?' Mouret asked the
priest timidly, as he met the latter going down into the
garden.</p>

<p>'Oh, fairly well; but it will be a long convalescence, and
very great care will be required.'</p>

<p>The priest tranquilly read his breviary, while the father,
with a pair of shears in his hand, followed him up and down
the garden walks, trying to renew the conversation and to
get more detailed information about his boy. As his son's
convalescence progressed, he remarked that the priest scarcely
ever left Serge's room. He had gone upstairs several times
in the women's absence, and he had always found the Abbé
at the young man's bedside, talking softly to him, and rendering
him all kinds of little services, sweetening his drink,
straightening his bed-clothes, or getting him anything he
happened to want. There was a hushed murmur throughout
the house, a solemn calm which gave quite a conventual
character to the second floor. Mouret seemed to smell
incense, and could almost fancy sometimes, as he heard a
muttering of voices, that they were saying mass upstairs.</p>

<p>'What can they be doing?' he wondered. 'The youngster
is out of danger now; they can't be giving him extreme
unction.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>Serge himself caused him much disquiet. He looked like
a girl as he lay in bed in his white night-dress. His eyes
seemed to have grown larger; there was a soft ecstatic smile
upon his lips, which still played there even amidst his keenest
pangs of suffering. Mouret no longer ventured to say anything
about Paris; his dear sick boy seemed too girlish and
tender for such a journey.</p>

<p>One afternoon he went upstairs, carefully hushing the
sound of his steps. The door was ajar, and he saw Serge
sitting in an easy chair in the sunshine. The young fellow
was weeping with his eyes turned upward, and his mother
stood sobbing in front of him. They both turned as they
heard the door open, but they did not wipe away their tears.
As soon as Mouret entered the room, the invalid said to him
in his feeble voice:</p>

<p>'I have a favour to ask you, father. Mother says that
you will be angry and will refuse me permission, though it
would fill me with joy&mdash;I want to enter the Seminary.'</p>

<p>He clasped his hands together with a sort of feverish
devotion.</p>

<p>'You! you!' exclaimed Mouret.</p>

<p>He looked at Marthe, who turned away her head. Then
saying nothing further, he walked to the window, returned,
and sat down mechanically by the bedside, as though overwhelmed
by the blow.</p>

<p>'Father,' resumed Serge, after a long silence, 'in my
nearness to death I have seen God, and I have sworn to be
His. I assure you that all my happiness is centred in that.
Believe me that it is so, and do not cause me grief.'</p>

<p>Mouret, looking very mournful, with his eyes lowered, still
kept silence. At last, with an expression of utter hopelessness,
he murmured:</p>

<p>'If I had the least particle of courage, I should wrap a
couple of shirts in a handkerchief and go away.'</p>

<p>Then he rose from his seat, went to the window and
drummed on the panes with his fingers; and when Serge
again began to implore him, he said very quietly:</p>

<p>'Very well, my boy; be a priest.'</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards he left the room.</p>

<p>The next day, without the least warning to anyone, he
set off for Marseilles, where he spent a week with his son
Octave. But he came back looking careworn and aged.
Octave had afforded him very little consolation. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
found the young man leading a fast life, overwhelmed with
debts and in all sorts of scrapes. However, Mouret did not
say a word about these matters. He began to lead a perfectly
sedentary existence, and no longer made any of those good
strokes of business, those fortunate purchases of standing
crops, in which he had formerly taken such pride. Rose
noticed that he maintained almost unbroken silence, and that
he even avoided saluting Abbé Faujas.</p>

<p>'Do you know that you are not very polite?' she boldly
said to him one day. 'His reverence the Curé has just gone
past, and you turned your back upon him. If you behave in
this way because of the boy, you are under a great mistake.
The Curé was quite against his going to the Seminary, and I
often heard him talking to him against it. This house is
getting a very cheerful place, indeed, now! You never speak
a word, even to madame, and when you have your meals, anyone
would think that it was a funeral that was going on. For
my part, sir, I'm beginning to feel that I've had quite enough
of it.'</p>

<p>Mouret went out of the room, but the cook followed him
into the garden.</p>

<p>'Haven't you every reason to be happy, now that your son
is on his feet again? He ate a cutlet yesterday, the darling,
and with such a good appetite too. But you care nothing
about that, do you? What you want is to make a pagan of
him like yourself. Ah! you stand in great need of some one
to pray for you. But God Almighty wishes to save us all.
If I were you I should weep with joy, to think that that poor
little dear was going to pray for me. But you are made of
stone, sir! And how sweet he will look too, the darling, in
his cassock!'</p>

<p>Mouret thereupon went up to the first floor, and shut himself
up in a room which he called his study, a big bare room,
furnished only with a table and a couple of chairs. This
room became his refuge whenever the cook worried him.
When he grew weary of staying there, he went down again
into the garden, upon which he expended greater care than
ever. Marthe no longer seemed to be conscious of her
husband's displeasure. Sometimes he kept silent for a week,
but she was in no way disquieted or distressed by it. Every
day she withdrew more and more from her surroundings, and
she even began to fancy, now that the house seemed so quiet
and peaceable and she had ceased to hear Mouret scolding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
that he had grown more reasonable and had discovered for
himself, as she had done, some little nook of happiness. This
thought tranquillised her and induced her to plunge more
deeply into her dreamy life. When her husband looked at
her with his blurred eyes, scarcely recognising in her the wife
of other days, she only smiled at him and did not notice the
tears which were welling beneath his eyelids.</p>

<p>On the day when Serge, now completely restored to health,
entered the Seminary, Mouret remained at home alone with
Désirée. He now frequently looked after her; for this big
'innocent' girl, who was nearly sixteen, might have fallen
into the basin of the fountain or have set the house on fire
with matches just like a child of six. When Marthe returned
home, she found the doors open and the rooms empty. The
house seemed quite deserted. She went on to the terrace,
and there, at the end of one of the walks, she saw her husband
playing with his daughter. He was sitting on the gravel, and
with a little wooden scoop was gravely filling a cart which
Désirée was pulling along with a piece of string.</p>

<p>'Gee up! gee up!' cried the girl.</p>

<p>'Wait a little,' said her father patiently, 'it is not full
yet. As you are the horse, you must wait till the cart is
full.'</p>

<p>Then she stamped her feet like an impatient horse, and, at
last, not being able to stand still any longer, she set off with
a loud burst of laughter. The cart fell over and lost its load.
When she had dragged it round the garden, she came back to
her father crying:</p>

<p>'Fill it again! Fill it again!'</p>

<p>Mouret loaded it again with the little scoop. For a moment
Marthe remained upon the terrace watching them, full
of uneasy emotion. The open doors, the sight of the man
playing with the child, the empty deserted house all touched
her with sadness, though she was not clearly conscious of the
feelings at work in her. She went upstairs to take off her
things, on hearing Rose, who also had just returned, exclaim
from the terrace steps:</p>

<p>'Good gracious! how silly the master is!'</p>

<p>His friends, the retired traders with whom he took a turn
or two every day on the promenade in the Cours Sauvaire,
declared that he was a little 'touched.' During the last few
months his hair had grizzled, he had begun to get shaky on
his legs, and was no longer the biting jeerer, feared by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
whole town. For a little time it was thought that he had
been venturing upon some risky speculations and had been
overcome by a heavy loss of money.</p>

<p>Madame Paloque, as she leaned over the window-rail of
her dining-room which overlooked the Rue Balande, said
every time she saw him, that he was certainly going to the
bad. And if, a few moments later, she happened to catch
sight of Abbé Faujas passing along the street, she took a
delight in exclaiming&mdash;the more especially if she had visitors
with her:</p>

<p>'Just look at his reverence the Curé! Isn't he growing
sleek? If he eats out of the same dish as Mouret, he can
leave him nothing but the bones.'</p>

<p>Then she laughed, as did those who heard her. Abbé
Faujas was, indeed, becoming quite an imposing object; he
now always wore black gloves and a shimmering cassock. A
peculiar smile played about his face, a sort of ironical twist of
his lips, when Madame de Condamin complimented him upon
his appearance. The ladies liked to see him nicely and comfortably
dressed; though the priest himself would probably
have preferred fighting his way with bare arms and clenched
fists, and never a thought about what he wore. Whenever
he appeared to grow neglectful of his appearance, the slightest
hint of reproach from old Madame Rougon sufficed to cure
him, and he hurried off to buy silk stockings and a new
hat and girdle. He was frequently requiring new clothes,
for his big frame seemed to wear out his garments very
quickly.</p>

<p>Since the foundation of the Home of the Virgin, all the
women had been on his side; and defended him against the
malicious stories which were still occasionally repeated, though
no one was able to get at their origin. Now and then they
found him a little blunt, but this roughness of his by no
means offended them, least of all in the confessional, where
they rather liked to feel his iron hand pressing down their
necks.</p>

<p>'He gave me such a scolding yesterday, my dear,' said
Madame de Condamin to Marthe one day. 'I believe he
would have struck me if there had not been the partition
between us. He is not always very easy to get on with!'</p>

<p>She laughed gently and seemed to enjoy the recollection
of this scene with her spiritual director. Madame de Condamin
had observed Marthe turn pale whenever she made her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
certain confidences as to Abbé Faujas's manner of hearing
confessions; and divining her jealousy, she took a mischievous
delight in tormenting her, with which object she gave her
many further private details.</p>

<p>When Abbé Faujas had founded the Young Men's Club,
he there became quite sociable and gay; in fact he seemed to
have undergone a transformation. Thanks to his will power
he moulded his stern nature like wax. He allowed the part
which he had taken in the founding of the club to be made
public, and he became the friend of all the young men in the
town, keeping a strict watch over his manners, for he well
knew that young men just fresh from college had not the
same taste for roughness of speech and demeanour as the
women had. He one day narrowly escaped losing his temper
with young Rastoil, whose ears he threatened to pull, over a
disagreement about the club management; but with surprising
command over himself, he put out his hand to him
almost immediately afterwards, humbling himself and winning
over to his side all who were present by his gracious
apologies to 'that big fool Séverin,' as the other was called.</p>

<p>However, although the Abbé had conquered the women
and the young men, he still remained on a footing of mere
formal politeness with the fathers and husbands. The grave
gentlemen continued to distrust him as they saw that he still
refrained from identifying himself with any political party.
At the Sub-Prefecture Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies discussed
him with much animation, while Monsieur Delangre,
without definitely defending him, said with a sharp smile that
they ought to wait before judging him. At the Rastoils' he
had become a source of much tribulation to the Presiding
Judge, whom Séverin and his mother never ceased wearying
with their constant eulogies of the priest.</p>

<p>'Well! well! let him have every good quality under the
sun!' cried the unhappy man. 'I won't dispute one of them,
only leave me at peace. I asked him to dinner, but he
wouldn't come. I can't go and drag him here by force!'</p>

<p>'No, but, my dear,' said Madame Rastoil, 'when you meet
him you scarcely bow to him. It's that, I dare say, that has
made him rather cold.'</p>

<p>'Of course it is,' interposed Séverin; 'he sees very well
that you are not as polite to him as you ought to be.'</p>

<p>Monsieur Rastoil shrugged his shoulders. When Monsieur
de Bourdeu was there, the pair of them accused Abbé Faujas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
of leanings towards the Sub-Prefecture, though Madame
Rastoil directed their attention to the fact that he never dined
there, and had never even set foot in the house.</p>

<p>'Oh, don't imagine that I accuse him of being a Bonapartist,'
said the president. 'I only remarked that he had
leanings that way; that was all. He has had communications
with Monsieur Delangre.'</p>

<p>'Well! and so have you!' cried Séverin; 'you have had
communications with the mayor! They are absolutely necessary
under certain circumstances. Tell the truth and say you
detest Abbé Faujas; it would be much more straightforward.'</p>

<p>For whole days at a time the Rastoils sulked with one
another. Abbé Fenil came to see them very rarely now,
excusing himself upon the ground that he was kept at home
by his gout; but twice, when he had been forced to express
an opinion on the Curé of Saint-Saturnin's, he had said a
few words in his praise. Abbé Surin and Abbé Bourrette, as
well as Monsieur Maffre, held the same views as the mistress
of the house concerning the Curé, and the opposition to him
came only from Monsieur Rastoil, backed up by Monsieur
de Bourdeu, both of whom gravely declared that they could
not compromise their political positions by receiving a man
who concealed his views.</p>

<p>Séverin, however, now began to knock at the door in the
Impasse des Chevillottes whenever he wanted to say anything
to the priest, and gradually the little lane became a sort of
neutral ground. Doctor Porquier, who had been the first to
avail himself of it, young Delangre, and the magistrate, all
came thither to talk to Abbé Faujas. Sometimes the little
doors of both the gardens, as well as the cart-entrance to the
Sub-Prefecture, were kept open for a whole afternoon, while
the Abbé leant against the wall, smiling and shaking hands
with those members of the two groups who wished to have a
word with him. Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies, however,
carefully refrained from leaving the garden of the Sub-Prefecture;
and Monsieur Rastoil and Monsieur de Bourdeu,
equally persistent, remained seated beneath the trees in front
of the former's waterfall. It was very seldom that the priest's
little court invaded the Mourets' arbour. Now and then a
head just peeped inside, took a hasty glance around, and then
quickly disappeared.</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas now seemed to trouble about nothing. At
the most he glanced with an expression of disquietude at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Tronches' windows, through which Olympe's eyes were constantly
glistening. The Trouches kept themselves in ambush
there behind the red curtains, full of an envious desire to
come down like the Abbé and eat the fruit, and talk to the
fashionable folks. They tapped on the shutters, leant out
of the window for a moment, and then withdrew, infuriated
by the authoritative glances of the priest. Soon afterwards,
however, they would return with stealthy steps, press their
pale faces to one of the panes, and keep watch over his every
movement, quite tortured to see him enjoying that paradise
which was forbidden to them.</p>

<p>'It is really abominable!' Olympe exclaimed one day to
her husband. 'He would lock us up in a cupboard, if he could,
so as to deprive us of every atom of enjoyment. We'll go
down if you like, and we'll see what he says.'</p>

<p>Trouche had just returned from his office. He put on a
clean collar and dusted his boots, anxious to make himself as
neat as possible. Olympe put on a light dress, and then they
both boldly came downstairs into the garden, walking slowly
alongside the tall box plants, and stopping in front of the
flower-beds.</p>

<p>At that moment Abbé Faujas happened to have his back
turned towards them. He was standing at the little door
that opened into the lane talking to Monsieur Maffre. When
he heard the Trouches' steps grating upon the gravel, they
were close behind him under the arbour. He turned round,
and stopped short in the middle of a sentence, quite astounded
at seeing them there. Monsieur Maffre, who did not know
them, was looking at them with curiosity.</p>

<p>'A beautiful day, isn't it, gentlemen?' said Olympe, who
had turned pale beneath her brother's gaze.</p>

<p>The Abbé abruptly dragged the justice of the peace into
the lane; where he quickly got rid of him.</p>

<p>'He is furious!' murmured Olympe. 'Well, so much the
worse; we had better stay where we are now. If we go back
upstairs, he will think we are afraid of him. I've had quite
enough of this kind of thing, and you will see what I will say
to him.'</p>

<p>She made Trouche seat himself on one of the chairs which
Rose had brought out a short time previously, and when the
Abbé returned he found them tranquilly settled there. He
fastened the bolts of the little door, glanced quickly around
to assure himself that the trees screened them from observation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
and then came up close to the Trouches, saying in a
muffled voice:</p>

<p>'You forget our agreement. You undertook to remain in
your own rooms.'</p>

<p>'It was too hot up there,' Olympe replied. 'We are not
committing any crime by coming down here to get a little
fresh air.'</p>

<p>The priest was on the point of exploding, but his sister,
still quite pale from the effort she had made in resisting him,
added in a peculiar tone:</p>

<p>'Don't make a noise, now! There are some people over
there, and you might do yourself harm.'</p>

<p>Then both the Trouches laughed slightly. The Abbé fixed
his eyes upon them with a terrible expression, but without
speaking.</p>

<p>'Sit down,' said Olympe. 'You want an explanation,
don't you? Well, you shall have one. We are tired of
imprisoning ourselves. You are living here in clover; the
house seems to belong to you, and so does the garden. So
much the better, indeed; we are delighted to see how well
things appear to be going with you, but you mustn't treat us
as dirt beneath your feet. You have never thought of bringing
me up a single bunch of grapes; you have given us the most
wretched of the rooms; you hide us away and are ashamed
of us; you shut us up as though we had the plague. You
must understand that it can't go on any longer!'</p>

<p>'I am not the master here,' replied Abbé Faujas. 'You
must address yourselves to Monsieur Mouret if you want to
strip his garden.'</p>

<p>The Trouches exchanged a fresh smile.</p>

<p>'We don't want to pry into your affairs,' Olympe continued.
'We know what we know, and that is sufficient for
us. But all this proves what a bad heart you have. Do you
think that if we were in your position we shouldn't invite you
to come and take your share in the good things that were
going?'</p>

<p>'What is it that you want me to do?' demanded the Abbé.
'Do you suppose that I am rolling in wealth? You know
what sort of a room I occupy myself; it is more scantily
furnished than your own. The house isn't mine, and I can't
give it you.'</p>

<p>Olympe shrugged her shoulders. She silenced her husband
who was beginning to speak, and then calmly continued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>'Everyone has his own ideas of life. If you had millions
you wouldn't buy a strip of carpet for your bedside; you
would spend them all in some foolish scheme or other. We,
on the other hand, like to be comfortable. Dare you say that
if you had a fancy for the handsomest furniture in the house
and for the linen and food and anything else it contains, you
couldn't have them this very evening? Well, in such
circumstances a good brother would think of his relations,
and wouldn't leave them in wretchedness and squalor as you
leave us!'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas looked keenly at the Trouches. They were
both swaying backwards and forwards on their chairs.</p>

<p>'You are a pair of ungrateful people,' he said after a
moment's silence. 'I have already done a great deal for you.
You have me to thank for the food that you eat now. I
still have letters of yours, Olympe, letters in which you
beseech me to rescue you from your misery by bringing you
over to Plassans. Now that you are here and your livelihood
is assured, you break out into fresh demands.'</p>

<p>'Stuff!' Trouche impudently interrupted. 'You sent for
us here because you wanted us. I have learned to my cost
not to believe in anyone's fine talk. I have allowed my wife
to speak, but women can never come to the point. In two
words, my good friend, you are making a mistake in keeping
us cooped up like dogs, who are only brought out in the hour
of danger. We are getting weary of it, and we shall perhaps
end by doing something foolish. Confound it all! give us a
little liberty. Since the house isn't yours and you despise all
luxury, what harm can it do you if we make ourselves comfortable?
We shan't eat the walls!'</p>

<p>'Of course!' exclaimed Olympe, 'it's only natural that
we should rebel against being constantly locked up. We
will take care to do nothing to prejudice you. You know
that my husband only requires the least sign from you. Go
your own way, and you may depend upon us; but let us go
ours. Is that understood, eh?'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas had bent his head; he remained silent for
a moment, and then, raising his eyes, and avoiding a direct
reply, he said:</p>

<p>'Listen to what I say. If ever you do anything to hamper
me, I swear to you that I will send you away to starve in a
garret on the straw.'</p>

<p>Then he went back into the house, leaving them under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the arbour. From that time the Trouches went down into
the garden almost every day, but they conducted themselves
with considerable discretion, and refrained from going there
at the times when the priest was talking with the guests from
the neighbouring gardens.</p>

<p>The following week Olympe complained so much of the
room she was occupying that Marthe kindly offered her
Serge's, which was now at liberty. The Trouches then kept
both rooms. They slept in the young man's old bedchamber,
from which not a single article of furniture had been removed,
and turned the other apartment into a sort of drawing-room,
for which Rose found them some old velvet-covered
furniture in the lumber-room. Olympe, in great delight,
ordered a rose-coloured dressing-gown from the best maker
in Plassans.</p>

<p>Mouret, who had forgotten that Marthe had asked his
permission to let the Trouches have Serge's room, was quite
surprised to find them there one evening. He had gone up
to look for a knife which he thought his son must have left
in one of the drawers, and, as he entered the room, he saw
Trouche trimming with this very knife a switch which he had
just cut from one of the pear-trees in the garden. Thereupon
he apologised and went downstairs.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="XIV" id="XIV">XIV</a></h3>


<p>During the public procession on the Feast of Corpus Christi,
when Monseigneur Rousselot came down the steps of the
magnificent altar, set up through the generosity of Madame
de Condamin on the Place of the Sub-Prefecture, close to the
very door of the small house she occupied, it was noticed
with much surprise by the spectators that the Bishop abruptly
turned his back upon Abbé Faujas.</p>

<p>'Ah! has there been some disagreement between them!'
exclaimed Madame Rougon, who was looking out of her
drawing-room window.</p>

<p>'Didn't you know about it?' asked Madame Paloque, who
was leaning over by the old lady's side. 'It has been the talk
of the town since yesterday. Abbé Fenil has been restored
to favour.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>Monsieur de Condamin, who was standing behind the
ladies, began to laugh. He had made his escape from his
own house, saying that it smelt like a church.</p>

<p>'Do you attach any importance to such trifles?' said he.
'The Bishop is merely an old weathercock, turning one way
or the other according as Faujas or Fenil blows against
him; to-day it is one of them, to-morrow it will be the other.
They have quarrelled and made it up again half a score times
already. Before three days are over, you will see that Faujas
will be the pet again.'</p>

<p>'I don't believe it,' exclaimed Madame Paloque; 'it is
serious this time. It seems that Abbé Faujas has caused
his lordship a great deal of worry. It appears that he formerly
preached some sermons which excited great displeasure at
Rome. I can't explain the matter quite clearly, but I know
that the Bishop has received reproachful letters from Rome,
in which he is recommended to be on his guard. It is said
that Abbé Faujas is simply a political agent.'</p>

<p>'Who says so?' asked Madame Rougon, blinking her
eyes as though to see the procession, which was then passing
through the Rue de la Banne, more distinctly.</p>

<p>'I heard it said, but I really don't remember by whom,'
the judge's wife replied carelessly.</p>

<p>Then she retired, saying that one would be able to get a
better view from the side-window. Monsieur de Condamin,
however, took the vacant place by Madame Rougon, and
whispered in the old lady's ear:</p>

<p>'I have already twice seen her going to Abbé Fenil's.
They have some plot or other in hand, I'm sure. Abbé
Faujas must have trodden somehow or other on that viper of
a woman, and she's trying to bite him. If she were not so
ugly I would do her the service of telling her that her husband
will never be presiding judge.'</p>

<p>'Why? I don't understand,' murmured the old lady,
with a guileless expression.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Condamin looked at her curiously, and then
began to smile.</p>

<p>The last two gendarmes in the procession had just disappeared
round the corner of the Cours Sauvaire, and the few
guests whom Madame Rougon had invited to witness the
blessing of the altar returned into the drawing-room, where
they chatted for a moment about the Bishop's graciousness
and the new banners of the different congregations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
especially the one belonging to the girls of the Home of the
Virgin, which had attracted much attention. The ladies
were loud in their praises, and Abbé Faujas's name was
mentioned every moment in the most eulogistic terms.</p>

<p>'He is clearly a saint!' sniggered Madame Paloque to
Monsieur de Condamin, who had taken a seat near her.</p>

<p>Then, bending forward towards him, she added:</p>

<p>'I could not speak openly before Madame Rougon, you
know, but there is a great deal of talk about Abbé Faujas
and Madame Mouret. I dare say those unpleasant reports
have reached the Bishop's ears.'</p>

<p>'Madame Mouret is a charming woman, and extremely
winning notwithstanding her forty years,' was all that
Monsieur de Condamin said in reply.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes! she is very charming, very charming, indeed,'
murmured Madame Paloque, whose face turned quite green
with spleen.</p>

<p>'Extremely charming,' persisted the conservator of rivers
and forests. 'She is at the age of genuine passion and great
happiness. You ladies are given to judging each other
unfavourably.'</p>

<p>Thereupon he left the drawing-room, chuckling over
Madame Paloque's suppressed rage.</p>

<p>The town was now indeed taking an absorbing interest in
the continual struggle that went on between Abbé Faujas
and Abbé Fenil for influence over the Bishop. It was a
ceaseless combat, like the struggles of a couple of buxom
housekeepers for the affection of an old dotard. The Bishop
smiled knowingly; he had discovered how to maintain a
kind of equilibrium between these opposing forces which he
pitted one against the other, amused at seeing them overthrown
in turn, and securing peace for himself by accepting
the services of the one who temporarily gained the upper
hand. To the dreadful stories which were told him to the
detriment of his favourites, he paid but little attention, for
he knew that the rival Abbés were capable of accusing each
other of murder.</p>

<p>'They are getting worse, my child,' the Bishop said, in
one of his expansive moments to Abbé Surin. 'I fancy that
in the end Paris will carry the day, and Rome will get the
worst of it; but I am not quite sure, and I shall leave them
to wear each other out. When one has made an end of the
other, things will be settled&mdash;&mdash;By the way, just read me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the third Ode of Horace; I'm afraid I've translated one of
the lines rather badly.'</p>

<p>On the Tuesday after the public procession the weather
was lovely. Laughter was heard both in the garden of the
Rastoils and in that of the Sub-Prefect, and numerous guests
were sitting under the trees. Abbé Faujas read his breviary
in the Mourets' garden after his usual custom, while slowly
walking up and down beside the tall hedges of box. For
some days past he had kept the little door that led to the
lane bolted; he was indeed coquetting with his neighbours
and keeping aloof, in order that he might make them more
anxious to see him. Possibly too he had noticed a slight
coldness in their manner after his last misunderstanding
with the Bishop, and the abominable reports that his enemies
had circulated against him.</p>

<p>About five o'clock, just as the sun was sinking, Abbé
Surin proposed a game of shuttlecock to Monsieur Rastoil's
daughters. He was very clever at it himself; and, notwithstanding
the approach of their thirtieth year, both Angéline
and Aurélie were immensely fond of games. When the
servant brought the battledores, Abbé Surin, looking about
him for a shady spot, for the garden was still bright with the
last rays of the sun, was struck with an idea of which the
young ladies cordially approved.</p>

<p>'Shall we go and play in the Impasse des Chevillottes?'
he asked. 'We shall be shaded by the chestnut-trees there,
and have more room.'</p>

<p>They left the garden and started a most delightful game
in the lane. The two girls began, and Angéline was the first
who failed to keep the shuttlecock going. Abbé Surin, who
took her place, handed his battledore with professional skill
and ease. Having tucked his cassock between his legs, he
sprang backwards and forwards and sideways without cessation.
His battledore caught the shuttlecock as it reached the
ground and sent it flying, now to a surprising height, and now
straight ahead like a bullet; and at times made it describe
the most graceful curves. As a rule he preferred to be pitted
against poor players, who, as they struck the shuttlecock at
random, or, to use his own phrase, without any rhythm,
brought all the skilful agility of his own play into exercise.
Mademoiselle Aurélie, however, played a fair game. She
vented a little cry like a swallow's every time she struck a
blow with the battledore, and she laughed distractedly when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
shuttlecock alighted on the young Abbé's nose. Gathering
up her skirts, she waited for its return, or leaped backward
with a great rustling of petticoats when he vengefully gave it
a smarter blow than usual. At last the shuttlecock fell into
her hair, and she almost toppled over upon her back. This
greatly amused them all. Angéline now took her sister's
place; and every time that Abbé Faujas raised his eyes from
his breviary as he paced the Mourets' garden, he saw the
white feathers of the shuttlecock skimming above the wall
like a big butterfly.</p>

<p>'Are you there, your reverence?' all at once cried
Angéline, at the little door. 'Our shuttlecock has fallen into
your garden.'</p>

<p>The Abbé picked up the shuttlecock, which had dropped
at his feet, and made up his mind to open the door.</p>

<p>'Oh, thank you! your reverence,' said Aurélie, who had
already taken the battledore. 'Only Angéline would ever
make such a stroke. The other day when papa was watching
us she sent the shuttlecock right against his ear with such a
bang that he was quite deaf till the next day.'</p>

<p>There was more laughter at this; and Abbé Surin, as rosy
as a girl, delicately dabbed his brow with a handkerchief of
fine texture. He pushed his fair hair behind his ears, and
stood there with glistening eyes and flexible figure, using his
battledore as a fan. In the excitement of the game his bands
had got slightly displaced.</p>

<p>'Monsieur le Curé,' said he, as he took up his position
again, 'you shall be umpire.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas, holding his breviary under his arm and
smiling paternally, stood on the threshold of the little doorway.
Through the cart-entrance of the Sub-Prefecture, which
was half open, he could see Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies
seated in front of the cascade amidst his friends. The priest
looked straight in front of him, however, and counted the
points of the game, while complimenting Abbé Surin and
consoling the young ladies.</p>

<p>'I tell you what, Péqueur,' said Monsieur de Condamin,
in a whisper, in the sub-prefect's ear, 'you make a mistake in
not inviting that little Abbé to your parties. He is a great
favourite with the ladies, and he looks as though he could
waltz to perfection.'</p>

<p>Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies, who was talking to Monsieur
Delangre with much animation, did not however appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
to hear the other, but went on with his conversation with the
mayor.</p>

<p>'Really, my dear sir,' he said, 'I don't know where you
see all the merits that you profess to find in him. On the
contrary, indeed, Abbé Faujas appears to me to be of very
doubtful character. There is considerable suspicion attached
to his past career, and strange things are said about him here.
I really don't see why I should go down on my knees to this
priest, especially as the clergy of Plassans are hostile to us.
I should gain no advantage by doing so.'</p>

<p>Monsieur Delangre and Monsieur de Condamin exchanged
glances of intelligence, and then, by way of reply, nodded their
heads.</p>

<p>'None, whatever,' continued the sub-prefect. 'It is no
use pretending to look mysterious; I may tell you that I have
myself written to Paris. I was a good deal bothered, and I
wanted to be quite certain about this Faujas, whom you seem
to look upon as a sort of prince in disguise. Well! do you
know what reply I got? They told me that they did not know
him and could tell me nothing about him, and that I must carefully
avoid mixing myself up with clerical matters. They are
grumpy enough in Paris as it is, since the election of that
jackass Lagrifoul, and I have to be prudent, you understand.'</p>

<p>The mayor exchanged another glance with the conservator
of rivers and forests. He even slightly shrugged his shoulders
before the correctly twirled moustaches of Monsieur Péqueur
des Saulaies.</p>

<p>'Just listen to me,' he said to him after a moment's
silence; 'you would like to be a prefect, wouldn't you?'</p>

<p>The sub-prefect smiled as he rocked himself in his chair.</p>

<p>'Well, then, go at once, and shake hands with Abbé
Faujas, who is waiting for you down there, while he is
watching them play at shuttlecock.'</p>

<p>Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies was silent with astonishment.
He seemed quite puzzled, turned towards Monsieur
de Condamin, and asked, with some show of uneasiness:</p>

<p>'Is that your advice also?'</p>

<p>'Certainly; go and offer him your hand,' replied the
conservator of rivers and forests.</p>

<p>Then, with a slight touch of irony, he added:</p>

<p>'Consult my wife, if you like; I know you have perfect
confidence in her.'</p>

<p>Madame de Condamin was just approaching them. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
was wearing a lovely pink and pearl-grey dress. When they
spoke to her of the Abbé she said graciously to the sub-prefect:</p>

<p>'It is very wrong of you to neglect your religious duties;
one never sees you at church except perhaps when there is
some official ceremony. It really distresses me very much,
and I must try to convert you. What sort of opinion do you
expect people will have of the government you represent, if
they see you are not on the side of religion?&mdash;Leave us,
gentlemen; I am going to confess Monsieur Péqueur.'</p>

<p>She took a seat, smiling playfully.</p>

<p>'Octavie,' said the sub-prefect, in an undertone, when they
were alone together, 'don't make fun of me. You weren't a
very pious person in the Rue du Helder in Paris. It's all I
can do to keep from laughing when I see you worshipping in
Saint-Saturnin's.'</p>

<p>'You are too flippant, my friend,' she replied, 'and your
flippancy will play you a bad turn one of these days. Seriously,
you quite distress me. I gave you credit for having more
intelligence. Are you so blind that you cannot see that you
are tottering in your position? Let me tell you that it is only
from fear of alarming the Legitimists at Plassans that you
haven't already been recalled. If the Legitimists saw a new
sub-prefect arriving here, they would take alarm, whereas so
long as you remain here they will continue quietly sleeping,
feeling certain of victory at the next election. All this is not
very flattering for you; I am aware of that, and the more so
as I know positively that the authorities are acting without
taking you into their confidence. Listen to me, my friend;
I tell you that you are ruined if you don't divine certain
things.'</p>

<p>He looked at her with unfeigned alarm.</p>

<p>'Has "the great man" been writing to you?' he asked,
referring to a personage whom they thus designated between
themselves.</p>

<p>'No; he has broken entirely with me. I am not a fool,
and I saw, before he did, the necessity of the separation.
And I have nothing at all to complain of. He has shown me
the greatest kindness. He found me a husband and gave me
some excellent advice, which has proved extremely useful to
me. But I have retained friends in Paris; and I swear to
you that you have only just got time left to cling on to the
branches if you don't want to fall. Don't be a pagan any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
longer, but go and offer your hand to Abbé Faujas. You will
understand why later on, even if you can't guess it to-day.'</p>

<p>Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies lowered his eyes and seemed
a little humiliated by the lesson he was receiving. He was
very conceited, and, showing his white teeth, he tried to
re-assert himself by murmuring tenderly:</p>

<p>'Ah! if you had only been willing, Octavie, we might have
governed Plassans between us. I asked you to resume that
delightful life&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Really now, you are a great idiot!' she interrupted in a
tone of vexation. 'You annoy me with your "Octavie." I am
Madame de Condamin to everyone, my friend. Can't you
understand anything? I have an income of thirty thousand
francs; I am queen of a whole Sub-Prefecture; I go everywhere;
I am respected everywhere, bowed to and liked.
What in the world should I do with you? You would only
inconvenience me. I am a respectable woman, my friend.'</p>

<p>She rose from her seat and walked towards Doctor Porquier,
who, according to his custom, had come to spend an
hour in the garden chatting to his fair patients, after a round
of visits.</p>

<p>'Oh, doctor!' she exclaimed, with one of her pretty grimaces,
'I have got such a headache. It pains me just here,
under the left eyebrow.'</p>

<p>'That is the side of the heart, madame,' said the doctor,
gallantly.</p>

<p>Madame de Condamin smiled and did not carry the consultation
any further. Madame Paloque, who was present,
bent, however, towards her husband, whom she brought with
her every time she came, in order that she might recommend
him to the sub-prefect's influence, and whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>'That's the only way Porquier has of curing them.'</p>

<p>When Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies had joined Monsieur
de Condamin and Monsieur Delangre he manœuvred
cleverly in such wise as to draw them towards the gateway.
When he was within a few yards of it, he stopped and
appeared to be interested in the game of shuttlecock which
was still going on in the lane. Abbé Surin, with his hair
blown about by the wind, the sleeves of his cassock rolled up,
and his slender, white, womanly wrists displayed, had just
stepped backwards, putting some twenty yards between himself
and Mademoiselle Aurélie. He felt that he was being
watched, and he quite surpassed himself. Mademoiselle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Aurélie was also playing extremely well, spurred on, as it
were, by the skill of her partner. Thus the shuttlecock
described long gentle curves with such regularity that it
seemed to light of its own accord upon the battledores, going
from one to the other player without either of them having to
stir from their places. Abbé Surin, inclined slightly backwards,
displayed his well-shaped bust to advantage.</p>

<p>'Excellent! excellent!' cried the sub-prefect. 'Ah!
Monsieur l'Abbé, I must compliment you upon your skill.'</p>

<p>Then, turning towards Madame de Condamin, Doctor
Porquier and the Paloques, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>'I've really never seen anything like it before. You will
allow us to admire your play, I hope, Monsieur l'Abbé?'</p>

<p>The whole set of the Sub-Prefecture now formed into a
group at the far end of the lane. Abbé Faujas had not
moved from the position he had taken up. Having acknowledged
with a nod the salutations of Monsieur Delangre and
Monsieur de Condamin, he went on counting the points of
the game. When Aurélie at last missed the shuttlecock, he
said good-naturedly:</p>

<p>'That makes you three hundred and ten points, for the
distance was altered; your sister has only forty-seven.'</p>

<p>However, while he appeared to follow the flight of the
shuttlecock with all-absorbing interest, he every now and then
glanced at the door of the Rastoils' garden, which still remained
open. Monsieur Maffre was as yet the only person
who had shown himself there; but at last a voice called from
inside the garden:</p>

<p>'What is amusing them so much out there?' It was
Monsieur Rastoil, who was chatting with Monsieur de
Bourdeu beside the rustic table, that asked the question.</p>

<p>'His lordship's secretary is playing at shuttlecock,' Monsieur
Maffre replied. 'He is making some wonderful strokes
and everybody is watching him. His reverence the Curé is
there, and seems quite amazed.'</p>

<p>Monsieur de Bourdeu took a big pinch of snuff as he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Ah! Monsieur l'Abbé Faujas is there, is he?'</p>

<p>He glanced at Monsieur Rastoil, and they both seemed ill
at ease.</p>

<p>'I have heard,' remarked the presiding judge, 'that the
Curé has been restored to the Bishop's favour.'</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed; this very morning,' said Monsieur Maffre.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
'There has been a complete reconciliation, and I have heard
some touching particulars about it. His lordship shed tears.
Ah, there can be no doubt that Abbé Fenil has cause for
self-reproach.'</p>

<p>'I thought that you were the grand-vicar's friend,' observed
Monsieur de Bourdeu.</p>

<p>'So I am, but I am also the Curé's friend,' replied the
justice of the peace. 'Thank goodness! he is a man of
sufficient piety to be able to despise all the calumnies of
his enemies. They haven't even hesitated to question his
morality! It is disgraceful!'</p>

<p>The ex-prefect again glanced at the presiding judge with
a singular expression.</p>

<p>'And they've tried to compromise him in political matters,'
continued Monsieur Maffre. 'They said that he had come
here to overturn everything, to bestow places right and left
and bring about the triumph of the Paris clique. Why, if he
had been the chief of a band of brigands folks couldn't have
said worse things about him than they have done. A pack of
lies, all of them!'</p>

<p>Monsieur de Bourdeu was drawing a face on the gravel of
the walk with the tip of his walking-stick.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, carelessly, 'I have heard these things mentioned.
But it is very unlikely that a minister of religion
would allow himself to play such a part; and besides, to the
honour of Plassans, I think it may be said that he would have
failed completely. There is no one here who could be bought.'</p>

<p>'Oh! it's all stuff and nonsense, that!' cried the presiding
judge, shrugging his shoulders. 'A town can't be
turned inside out like an old coat. Paris may send us as
many spies and agents as she likes, but Plassans will always
keep Legitimist. Look at that little Péqueur now! We've
only made a single mouthful of him! Folks must be very
stupid to believe in mysterious personages running about the
provinces offering places and appointments. I should be very
curious to see one of those gentlemen.'</p>

<p>He seemed to be getting a little angry, and Monsieur
Maffre, with some show of uneasiness, appeared to think it
necessary to defend himself.</p>

<p>'Pardon me,' he exclaimed. 'I have never asserted that
Abbé Faujas was a Bonapartist agent; on the contrary, I
have always considered the accusation a most absurd one.'</p>

<p>'Oh! it's not a question of Abbé Faujas. My remarks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
are quite general. People don't sell themselves in that way!
Abbé Faujas is above all suspicion.'</p>

<p>There was an interval of silence. Monsieur de Bourdeu
finished the face he was drawing on the gravel by adding a
long pointed beard to it.</p>

<p>'Abbé Faujas has no political views,' he at last said in
his dry voice.</p>

<p>'Evidently,' replied Monsieur Rastoil; 'we found fault
with him for his indifference, but now I approve of it. With
all this gossip in the air, it would have had a prejudicial
effect upon religion. You know as well as I do, Bourdeu,
that he can't be accused of the slightest suspicious step. He
has never been seen at the Sub-Prefecture, has he? He kept
with great propriety in his fitting place. If he were a Bonapartist,
he wouldn't be likely to conceal it, would he?'</p>

<p>'Certainly not.'</p>

<p>'Then, too, he leads a most exemplary life. My wife and
my son have told me things about him which have affected
me very much.'</p>

<p>The merriment in the little lane was now louder than
ever. Abbé Faujas could be heard complimenting Mademoiselle
Aurélie on some wonderful stroke of her battledore.
Monsieur Rastoil, who had checked himself for a moment,
continued, with a smile:</p>

<p>'Just listen to them! What can they find in it to amuse
them so much? It makes one quite long to be young again!'</p>

<p>Then, in a more serious tone, he added:</p>

<p>'Yes, my wife and my son have made me feel a strong
liking for Abbé Faujas; and we are very sorry that his discreet
reserve keeps him from joining our circle.'</p>

<p>As Monsieur Bourdeu nodded his head approvingly, shouts
of applause were heard in the alley. There was a perfect
uproar of hand-clapping, laughter and shouts, as though some
troop of school-boys had just rushed out to play. Monsieur
Rastoil rose from his rustic chair.</p>

<p>'Good gracious!' he said, with a smile; 'let us go and
see what they are up to. My legs are beginning to feel a
little cramped.'</p>

<p>The others followed him, and they all three went and
stood by the little door. It was the first time that the presiding
judge and the ex-prefect had ventured so far. When
they saw the group formed by the sub-prefect's guests at the
end of the lane, their faces assumed a serious expression.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies, for his part, drew himself up
and put on an official attitude. Madame de Condamin went
flitting to and fro along the lane laughing and smiling and
filling the place with the rustle of her pink and grey dress.
The two sets of guests kept glancing at one another, neither
being willing to retire, while Abbé Faujas still maintained his
position between them at Mouret's door, quietly enjoying
himself without seeming in the least degree conscious of the
delicacy of the situation.</p>

<p>All the spectators held their breath; for Abbé Surin, seeing
that their number had increased, was desirous of winning
their applause by a last exhibition of skill. He brought all
his science into play, created difficulties for himself on purpose
to overcome them, turned round and struck at the
shuttlecock without looking at it, but seemingly divining its
position, and thus sending it back over his head to Mademoiselle
Aurélie with mathematical precision. He was very
much flushed and was perspiring freely. He had thrown his
hat off, and his bands were now hanging over his right
shoulder. But he was the victor, and he looked as he always
did, amiable and charming. The two groups of guests
lingered there admiring him, and Madame de Condamin had
to repress the applause, which burst out prematurely and
inopportunely, by shaking her lace handkerchief. Then the
young Abbé, introducing still further refinements into his
play, began to skip about first to right and then to left, each
time receiving the shuttlecock in a fresh position. This was
the grand final flourish. He accelerated the rapidity of his
play, and at last, just as he was jumping aside, his foot
slipped and he nearly fell upon the bosom of Madame de
Condamin, who had stretched out her arms with a little cry.
The spectators, thinking he was hurt, rushed up, but the
Abbé, who was pressing the ground with his hands and knees,
sprang up again by a strong effort, and sent the shuttlecock,
which had not yet fallen, spinning back to Mademoiselle
Aurélie. Then, flourishing his battledore, he triumphed.</p>

<p>'Bravo! bravo!' cried Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies,
stepping up to him.</p>

<p>'Bravo! it was a magnificent stroke!' exclaimed Monsieur
Rastoil, who also came up.</p>

<p>The game was interrupted, for the two sets of guests had
now invaded the lane, and were mingled with each other,
crowding around Abbé Surin, who leant, quite out of breath,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
against the wall by Abbé Faujas's side. Everybody began
talking at once.</p>

<p>'I was afraid that he had split his skull,' said Doctor
Porquier to Monsieur Maffre, in a voice full of emotion.</p>

<p>'Yes, these games generally have a bad ending,' remarked
Monsieur de Bourdeu, addressing himself to Monsieur Delangre
and the Paloques, while he received a shake of the
hand from Monsieur de Condamin, whom he always tried to
avoid in the streets, so that he might not have to bow to
him.</p>

<p>Madame de Condamin went from the sub-prefect to the
presiding judge, bringing them face to face, and exclaiming:</p>

<p>'But really, I am more upset than he is! I thought that
we were going to fall together. There is a big stone there;
did you notice it?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I see it there,' said Monsieur Rastoil; 'it must have
caught against his heel.'</p>

<p>'Was it this round stone, do you think?' asked Monsieur
Péqueur des Saulaies, picking up a pebble.</p>

<p>They had never spoken to each other before, except at
official ceremonies. Now, however, they began to examine
the stone, and passed it from one to the other, remarking that
it was very sharp, and must have cut the Abbé's shoe.
Madame de Condamin stood smiling between them, and
assured them that she was beginning to feel better.</p>

<p>'Oh! the Abbé is feeling ill!' suddenly cried Monsieur
Rastoil's daughters.</p>

<p>Abbé Surin had, indeed, turned very pale at hearing of
the danger he had run. He was reeling with faintness, when
Abbé Faujas, who had kept aloof, took him in his powerful
arms, and carried him into Mouret's garden, where he seated
him upon a chair. The two sets of guests soon swarmed
into the arbour, where the young Abbé completely fainted
away.</p>

<p>'Get some water and some vinegar, Rose!' cried Abbé
Faujas, running towards the steps.</p>

<p>Mouret, who was in the dining-room, came to the window,
but, on seeing all those people in his garden, he recoiled as
though he were struck with fear, and kept himself out of
sight. Rose soon came up with a collection of drugs, muttering,
as she hastened along:</p>

<p>'If only madame were here! But she has gone to
the Seminary to see the lad. I am all alone, and I can't do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
impossibilities, can I? The master won't stir an inch; anybody
might die for all he cared. There he is in the dining-room,
hiding himself! He would let you die, before he would
get you even a glass of water.'</p>

<p>By the time she had got through this grumble, she had
reached Abbé Surin, who was lying in a swoon. 'Oh! the
cherub!' she exclaimed, overcome with womanly pity.</p>

<p>The young Abbé, with his closed eyes and his pale brow
wreathed with long, fair hair, looked like one of the sweet-faced
martyrs that one sees expiring in sacred pictures. The
elder of the Rastoil girls was supporting his head, which lay
back, allowing his delicate, white neck to be seen. They were
all in great excitement over him. Madame de Condamin
gently dabbed his brow with a rag soaked in vinegar and
water, and the others stood anxiously looking at her. At last
the young Abbé opened his eyes, but closed them again
immediately. He had two more swoons before he recovered.</p>

<p>'You have given me a terrible fright!' at last said
Doctor Porquier, who had kept his hand fast in his own.</p>

<p>Abbé Surin, still sitting on the chair, stammered out confused
thanks, and assured them all that it was a mere nothing.
Then he saw that his cassock had been unbuttoned, and he
smiled as he buttoned it and readjusted his bands. To prove
that he was all right again, when the company advised him
to keep quiet, he went back to the lane with the Rastoil girls
in order to finish the game.</p>

<p>'You have a very nice place here,' said Monsieur Rastoil
to Abbé Faujas, whose side he had not quitted.</p>

<p>'The air on this slope is delightful,' added Monsieur
Péqueur des Saulaies, in his charming manner.</p>

<p>Then both sets of guests began looking with curiosity at
Mouret's house.</p>

<p>'Perhaps the ladies and gentlemen would like to stay in
the garden a little while,' exclaimed Rose; 'I will go and get
some chairs.'</p>

<p>She made three journeys in quest of them, in spite of the
protestations of the company. Then, after glancing at each
other for a moment, the two sets of guests felt constrained
by courtesy to seat themselves. The sub-prefect installed
himself on Abbé Faujas's right hand, while the presiding
judge took a chair on his left, and a friendly conversation at
once began.</p>

<p>'You are a very quiet neighbour, Monsieur le Curé,' said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies very graciously; 'you can't
imagine what pleasure it gives me to see you every day at the
same hour in this little paradise. It seems to bring me a
feeling of restfulness, after all the noise and worry I have.'</p>

<p>'A pleasant neighbour is a very rare thing,' observed
Monsieur Rastoil.</p>

<p>'Quite true,' said Monsieur de Bourdeu. 'But his
reverence seems to have filled this spot with the peaceful
tranquillity of a cloister.'</p>

<p>While the Abbé was smiling and acknowledging these
complimentary remarks, Monsieur de Condamin, who had
not yet seated himself, stooped and whispered in Monsieur
Delangre's ear:</p>

<p>'There's Rastoil, hoping to get that lout of a son of his
made assessor to the public prosecutor.'</p>

<p>Monsieur Delangre, however, gave him an angry glance,
trembling at the thought that this incorrigible chatterer
might spoil everything. But this did not prevent the conservator
of rivers and forests from adding:</p>

<p>'And Bourdeu, too, is flattering himself that he has already
won back his prefecture.'</p>

<p>Meantime, Madame de Condamin had caused a great
sensation by saying, in a meaning way:</p>

<p>'What I like about this garden is the tender charm it
seems to possess, which makes it a nook apart from all the
cares and wretchedness of the world. It is a spot where even
Cain and Abel might have become reconciled.'</p>

<p>She emphasized her last words and gave two glances, one
to the right and the other to the left, towards the neighbouring
gardens. Monsieur Maffre and Doctor Porquier nodded
approvingly; while the Paloques looked at each other inquisitively,
feeling uneasy and fearing to compromise themselves
should they open their mouths.</p>

<p>At the end of a quarter of an hour Monsieur Rastoil rose
from his seat.</p>

<p>'My wife will be wondering where we have got to,' said
he.</p>

<p>And thereupon the whole company rose, feeling somewhat
embarrassed as to the manner of their leave-taking. But
Abbé Faujas spread out his hands and said, with the
pleasantest possible smile:</p>

<p>'My paradise is always open to you.'</p>

<p>The presiding judge then promised to come and see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Curé every now and then, and the sub-prefect, with more
effusiveness, declared that he would do the same. For another
five minutes they all lingered there, exchanging compliments,
while, out in the lane, the laughter of the Rastoil girls and
Abbé Surin was again heard. A fresh game was going on
with all the animation of the previous one, and the shuttlecock
could be seen passing backwards and forwards in its
regular flight above the garden wall.</p>

<p>One Friday, as Madame Paloque was entering Saint-Saturnin's,
she was greatly surprised to see Marthe kneeling
in front of Saint-Michael's chapel. The Abbé Faujas was
hearing confessions.</p>

<p>'Ah!' she muttered, 'has she succeeded in touching the
Abbé's heart? I must wait a little while and watch. It
would be very fine if Madame de Condamin were to come.'</p>

<p>She took a chair a little in the rear, and, half kneeling,
covered her face with her hands as though she was absorbed
in earnest prayer; but she held her fingers apart so that she
might glance between them. The church was very gloomy.
Marthe, with her head bent over her prayer-book, looked as
though she were asleep. Her figure snowed blackly against
a white pillar. Only her shoulders, heaving with deep-drawn
sighs, seemed to be alive. She was, indeed, so profoundly
overcome with emotion that she was constantly allowing her
turn to be taken by some other of Abbé Faujas's penitents.
The Abbé waited for a few moments, and then, seemingly a
little impatient, he began tapping the woodwork of the confessional.
Thereupon one of the women who were waiting,
seeing that Marthe showed no sign of moving, decided to take
her place. The chapel gradually grew empty, and Marthe still
remained motionless as if in ecstasy.</p>

<p>'She seems in a terrible state,' thought Madame Paloque.
'It is really quite indecent to make such an exhibition of
one's self in church. Ah! here comes Madame de Condamin!'</p>

<p>Madame de Condamin was indeed just entering the
church. She stopped for a moment before the holy-water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
basin, removed her glove, and crossed herself with a pretty
gesture. Her silk dress made a murmuring sound as she
passed along the narrow space between the chairs. As she
knelt down, she filled the lofty vault with a rustling of skirts.
She had her usual affable expression, and smiled through the
gloom. Soon she and Marthe were the only two penitents
left. The priest grew more and more impatient, and tapped
yet more loudly upon the woodwork of the confessional.</p>

<p>'It is your turn, madame; I am the last,' Madame de
Condamin whispered politely, bending towards Marthe, whom
she had not recognised.</p>

<p>Marthe raised her face, pinched and pale from her extreme
emotion, and did not appear to understand. It was as though
she were awakening from some ecstatic trance, and her eyelids
trembled.</p>

<p>'Come, ladies, come!' exclaimed Abbé Faujas, who had
now half-opened the door of the confessional.</p>

<p>Madame de Condamin smilingly rose to obey the priest's
summons; but Marthe, recognising her, hastened into the
chapel, to fall again upon her knees, however, a few paces
away from the confessional-box.</p>

<p>Madame Paloque felt much amused. She hoped that the
two ladies would seize each other by the hair. Marthe could
hear all that was said, for Madame de Condamin had a clear
flute-like voice. She dallied over the recital of her sins, and
quite animated the confessional with her pretty gossiping
ways. Once she even vented a little muffled laugh, at the
sound of which Marthe raised her pain-racked face. Soon
afterwards Madame de Condamin finished her confession, and
rose as if to retire, but she quickly stepped back and commenced
talking afresh, this time merely bending her head
without kneeling down.</p>

<p>'That she-devil is making sport of Madame Mouret and
the Abbé,' thought the judge's wife to herself. 'It's all put
on, is this.'</p>

<p>At last Madame de Condamin really withdrew. Marthe
watched her as if waiting till she disappeared. Then she
went forward, leant against the confessional-box, and fell
heavily on her knees. Madame Paloque had slipped a little
nearer and was craning out her head, but she could only see
the penitent's dark dress spread out around her. For nearly
half an hour there was not the slightest movement. Now and
then she thought she could detect some smothered sobs in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
throbbing silence, which was also broken at times by a creak
from the confessional-box. She began to feel a little weary
of her watching, for all she would be able to do now would be
to stare at Marthe as she left the chapel.</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas was the first to leave, closing the door of the
confessional-box with an appearance of annoyance. Madame
Mouret lingered there for a long time, bent and motionless.
When she at last went away, her face covered with her
veil, she seemed quite broken down, and even forgot to cross
herself.</p>

<p>'There has been a row; the Abbé hasn't made himself
pleasant,' thought Madame Paloque. Then she followed
Marthe as far as the Place de l'Archevêché, where she stopped
and seemed to hesitate for a moment. At last, having glanced
cautiously around to make sure that nobody was watching her,
she stealthily slipped into the house where Abbé Fenil resided,
at one of the corners of the Place.</p>

<p>Marthe now almost lived at Saint-Saturnin's. She carried
out her religious duties with the greatest fervour. Even Abbé
Faujas often had to remonstrate with her about her excessive
zeal. He only allowed her to communicate once a month,
fixed the hours which she should devote to pious exercises,
and insisted that she should not entirely shut herself up in
religious practices. She for a long time requested him to let
her attend a low mass every morning before he would accede
to her desire. One day, when she told him that she had lain
for a whole hour on the cold floor of her room to punish
herself for some fault she had committed, he was very angry
with her, and declared that her confessor alone had the right
to inflict penance. He treated her throughout very sternly,
and threatened to send her back to Abbé Bourrette if she did
not absolutely follow his directions.</p>

<p>'I was wrong to take you at all,' he often said; 'I do not
like disobedient souls.'</p>

<p>She felt a pleasure in his harshness. That iron hand
which bent her, and which held her back upon the edge
of the adoration in the depths of which she would have
liked to annihilate herself, thrilled her with ever-renewed
desire. She remained like a neophyte, making but little
advance in her journey of love, being constantly pulled up,
and vaguely divining some yet greater bliss beyond. The
sense of deep restfulness which she had first experienced in
the church, that forgetfulness of herself and the outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
world, now changed, however, into positive actual happiness.
It was the happiness for which she had been vaguely longing
since her girlhood, and which she was now, at forty years of
age, at last finding; a happiness which sufficed her, which
compensated her for all the past-away years, and made her
egotistical, absorbed in the new sensations that she felt
within her like sweet caresses.</p>

<p>'Be kind to me,' she murmured to Abbé Faujas, 'be kind
to me, for I stand in need of great kindness.'</p>

<p>And when he did show her kindness, she could have gone
down upon her knees and thanked him. At these times he
unbent, spoke to her in a fatherly way, and pointed out to
her that her imagination was too excited and feverish. God,
said he, did not like to be worshipped in that way, in wild
impulses. She smiled, looking quite pretty and young again
with her blushing face, and promised to restrain herself in
the future. But sometimes she experienced paroxysms of
devotion, which cast her upon the flag-stones in some dark
corner, where, almost grovelling, she stammered out burning
words. Even her power of speech then died away, and she
continued her prayers in feeling only, with a yearning of her
whole being, an appeal for that divine kiss which seemed
ever hovering about her brow without pressing it.</p>

<p>At home Marthe became querulous, she who till now had
been indifferent and listless, quite happy so long as her
husband left her at peace. Now, however, that he had begun
to spend all his time in the house, had lost his old spirit of
raillery, and had grown mopish and melancholy, she grew
impatient with him.</p>

<p>'He is always hanging about us,' she said to the cook
one day.</p>

<p>'Oh, he does it out of pure maliciousness,' replied Rose.
'He isn't a good man at heart. I haven't found that out to-day
for the first time. He has only put on that woebegone
look, he who is so fond of hearing his tongue wag, in order
to try to make us pity him. He's really bursting with
anger, but he won't show it, because he thinks that if he
looks wretched we shall be sorry for him and do just what he
wants. You are quite right, madame, not to let yourself be
influenced by all those grimaces and pretences.'</p>

<p>Mouret kept a hold upon the women with his purse. He
did not care to wrangle and argue with them, for fear of
making his life still less comfortable than it already was;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
but, though he no longer grumbled and meddled and interfered,
he showed his displeasure by refusing a single extra
crown piece to either Marthe or Rose. He gave the latter a
hundred francs a month for the purchase of provisions; wine,
oil, and preserves were in the house. The cook was obliged
to make the sum stated last her till the end of the month,
even if she had to pay for something out of her own pocket.
As for Marthe, she had absolutely nothing; her husband
never even gave her a sou, and she was compelled to appeal
to Rose, and ask her to try to save ten francs out of the
monthly allowance. She often found herself without a pair
of boots to put on, and was obliged to borrow from her
mother the money she needed to buy either a dress or a hat.</p>

<p>'But Mouret must surely be going mad!' Madame
Rougon cried. 'You can't go naked! I will speak to him
about it.'</p>

<p>'I beg you to do nothing of the kind, mother,' Marthe
said. 'He detests you, and he would treat me even worse
than he does already if he knew that I talked of these matters
to you.'</p>

<p>She began to cry as she added:</p>

<p>'I have shielded him for a long time, but I really can't
keep silent any longer. You remember that he was once
most unwilling for me even to set foot in the street; he kept
me shut up, and treated me like a mere chattel. Now he
behaves so unkindly because he sees that I have escaped
from him, and that I won't submit any longer to be a mere
servant. He is a man utterly without religion, selfish and
bad-hearted.'</p>

<p>'He doesn't strike you, does he?'</p>

<p>'No; but it will come to that. At present he contents
himself with refusing me everything. I have not bought any
chemises for the last five years, and yesterday I showed him
those I have. They are quite worn out, so patched and
mended that I am ashamed of wearing them. He looked at
them and examined them and said that they would do
perfectly well till next year. I haven't a single centime of my
own. The other day I had to borrow two sous from Rose to
buy some thread to sew up my gloves, which were splitting
all over.'</p>

<p>She gave her mother many other details of the straits to
which she was reduced&mdash;how she had to make laces for
her boots out of blackened string, how she had to wash her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
ribbons in tea to make her hat look a little fresher, and how
she had to smear the threadbare folds of her only silk dress
with ink to conceal the signs of wear. Madame Rougon expressed
great pity for her, and advised her to rebel. Mouret
was a monster, said she. Rose asserted that he carried his
avarice so far as to count the pears in the store-room and the
lumps of sugar in the cupboard, while he also kept a close
eye on the preserves, and ate himself all the remnants of the
loaves.</p>

<p>It was a source of especial distress to Marthe that she was
not able to contribute to the offertories at Saint-Saturnin's.
She used to conceal ten-sou pieces in scraps of paper and
carefully preserve them for high mass on Sundays. When
the lady patronesses of the Home of the Virgin made some
offering to the cathedral, such as a pyx, or a silver cross, or a
banner, she felt quite ashamed, and kept out of the way,
affecting ignorance of their intentions. The ladies felt much
pity for her. She would have robbed her husband if she
could have found the key of his desk, so keenly was she
tortured at being able to do nothing for the honour of the
church to which she was so passionately attached. She felt
all the jealousy of a deceived woman when Abbé Faujas used
a chalice which had been presented by Madame de Condamin;
whereas on the days when he said mass in front of the altar
cloth which she herself had embroidered she was filled with
fervent joy, and said her prayers with ecstatic thrills, as
though some part of herself lay beneath the priest's extended
hands. She would have liked to have had a whole chapel of
her own; and even dreamt of expending a fortune upon one,
and of shutting herself up in it and receiving the Deity alone
by herself at her own altar.</p>

<p>Rose, of whom she made a confidant, had recourse to all
sorts of plans to obtain money for her. That year she
secretly gathered the finest fruit in the garden and sold it,
and she also disposed of a lot of old furniture that was stowed
away in an attic, managing her sales so well that she succeeded
in getting together a sum of three hundred francs,
which she handed to Marthe with great triumph. The latter
kissed the old cook.</p>

<p>'Oh! how good you are!' she said to her, affectionately.
'Are you quite sure that he knows nothing about what you
have done? I saw the other day, in the Rue des Orfèvres,
two little cruets of chased silver, such dear little things; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
are marked two hundred francs. Now, you'll do me a little
favour, won't you? I don't want to go and buy them myself,
because someone would certainly see me going into the shop.
Tell your sister to go and get them. She can bring them
here after dark, and can give them to you through the kitchen
window.'</p>

<p>This purchase of the cruets seemed like a clandestine
intrigue to Marthe, and thrilled her with the sweetest pleasure.
For three days she kept the cruets at the bottom of a chest,
hidden away beneath layers of linen; and when she gave
them to Abbé Faujas in the sacristy of Saint-Saturnin's she
trembled so much that she could scarcely speak. The Abbé
scolded her in a kindly fashion. He was not fond of presents,
and spoke of money with the disdain of a strong-minded
man who only cares for power and authority. During his
earlier years of poverty, even at times when he and his
mother had no food beyond bread and water, he had never
thought of borrowing even a ten-franc piece from the
Mourets.</p>

<p>Marthe found a safe hiding-place for the hundred francs
which were still left her. She also was becoming a little
miserly; and she schemed how she should best expend this
money, making some fresh plan every morning. While she
was still in a state of hesitation, Rose told her that Madame
Trouche wished to see her privately. Olympe, who used to
spend hours in the kitchen, had become Rose's intimate
friend, and often borrowed a couple of francs of her to save
herself from going upstairs at times when she said that she
had forgotten to bring down her purse.</p>

<p>'Go upstairs and see her there,' said the cook; 'you will
be better able to talk there. They are good sort of people,
and they are very fond of his reverence. They have had a lot
of trouble. Madame Olympe has quite made my heart ache
with all the things she has told me.'</p>

<p>When Marthe went upstairs she found Olympe in tears.
They, the Trouches, were too soft-hearted, said she, and their
kindness was always being abused. Then she entered upon
an explanation of their affairs at Besançon, where the rascality
of a partner had saddled them with a heavy burden of debt.
To make matters worse, their creditors were getting angry,
and she had just received an insulting letter, the writer of
which threatened to communicate with the Mayor and the
Bishop of Plassans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>'I don't mind what happens to me,' she sobbed, 'but I
would give my head to save my brother from being compromised.
He has already done too much for us, and I don't
want to speak to him on the matter, for he is not rich, and
he would only distress himself to no purpose. Good heavens!
what can I do to keep that man from writing? My brother
would die of shame if such a letter were sent to the Mayor
and the Bishop. Yes, I know him well; he would die of
shame!'</p>

<p>Tears rushed to Marthe's eyes. She was quite pale, and
fervently pressed Olympe's hands. Then, without the latter
having preferred any request, she offered her the hundred
francs she had.</p>

<p>'It is very little, I know; but perhaps it might be
sufficient to avert the danger,' she said with an expression of
great anxiety.</p>

<p>'A hundred francs, a hundred francs!' exclaimed Olympe.
'Oh, no! he would never be satisfied with a hundred francs.'</p>

<p>Marthe lost all hope. She swore that she had not a
centime more. She so far forgot herself as to speak of the
cruets. If she had not bought them she would have been
able to give three hundred francs. Madame Trouche's eyes
sparkled.</p>

<p>'Three hundred francs, that is just what he demands,'
she said. 'Ah! you would have rendered my brother a much
greater service by not giving him that present, which, by the
way, will have to remain in the church. What a number of
beautiful things the ladies of Besançon presented to him!
But he isn't a bit the better off for them to-day! Don't
give him anything more; it is really nothing but robbery!
Consult me about what you do; there is so much hidden
misery&mdash;No! a hundred francs will certainly not be sufficient!'</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour spent in lamentation, however,
she accepted the hundred francs when she saw that Marthe
really had no more.</p>

<p>'I will send them so as to pacify the man a little,' she
said, 'but he won't leave us at peace long. Whatever you
do, I beg of you not to mention anything about it to my
brother. It would nearly kill him. And I think it would
be better, too, if my husband knew nothing of what has
passed between us; he is so proud that he would be sure to
be doing something rash to be able to acquit himself of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
obligation to you. We women can understand each other,
you know.'</p>

<p>This loan was a source of much pleasure to Marthe, who
henceforth had a fresh care, that of warding off from Abbé
Faujas the danger that threatened him without his being
aware of it. She frequently went upstairs to the Trouches'
rooms and stayed there for hours, discussing with Olympe
the best means of discharging the debts. The latter had
told her that a good many promissory notes had been endorsed
by the priest, and that there would be a terrible scandal if
they should ever be sent to any bailiff in Plassans to be
protested. The sum total of their liabilities was so great,
she said, that for a long time she refused to disclose it, only
weeping the more bitterly when Marthe pressed her. One
day, however, she mentioned the sum of twenty thousand
francs. Marthe was quite frozen upon hearing this. She
would never be able to procure anything like twenty thousand
francs, and thought that she would certainly have to wait for
Mouret's death before she could hope to have any such sum
at her disposal.</p>

<p>'I say twenty thousand francs in all,' Olympe hastily
added, disquieted by Marthe's grave appearance: 'but we
should be quite satisfied if we were able to pay by small
instalments spread over half a score of years. The creditors
would wait for any length of time, if they were only sure of
getting their instalments regularly. It is a great pity that
we can't find anyone who has sufficient confidence in us to
make the small necessary advances.'</p>

<p>This matter became an habitual topic of conversation.
Olympe also frequently spoke of Abbé Faujas, whom she
seemed almost to worship. She gave Marthe all kinds of
private details about the priest: such as, for instance, that
he could not bear anything that tickled him, that he could
sleep on his left side, and that he had a strawberry-mark on
his right shoulder, which turned red in May like the natural
fruit. Marthe smiled and never tired of hearing of these
little matters; and she questioned the young woman about
her childhood and that of her brother. When the subject
of the money cropped up she seemed painfully overcome by
her inability to do anything, and she even complained bitterly
of Mouret, to whom Olympe, emboldened by Marthe's
language, now always referred in her presence as the 'old
miser.' Sometimes when Trouche returned from his office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
he found the two women still talking together, but at his
appearance they checked themselves and changed the subject.
Trouche conducted himself in the most satisfactory way, and
the lady patronesses of the Home of the Virgin were highly
pleased with him. He was never seen in any of the cafés in
the town.</p>

<p>In order to be able to render some assistance to Olympe,
who sometimes talked about throwing herself out of the
window, Marthe made Rose take all the useless old odds and
ends that were lying about the house to a second-hand dealer
at the market. At first the two women were a little timid
about the matter, and only disposed of broken-down chairs
and tables when Mouret was out of the way, but afterwards
they began to lay hands upon more important articles, and
sold ornaments, pieces of china, and anything else they could
remove without its absence appearing too conspicuous. They
were slipping down a fatal incline, and would have ended
by carting off all the furniture in the house and leaving
nothing but the bare walls, if Mouret had not one day
charged Rose with thieving and threatened to send for the
police.</p>

<p>'What, sir! A thief! I!' she cried. 'Just because you
happened to see me selling one of madame's rings. Be careful
of what you are saying! The ring was mine; madame gave
it to me. Madame isn't such a mean wretch as you are.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself for leaving your wife
without a sou! She hasn't even a pair of shoes to put on!
The other day I had to pay the milkman myself! Yes, I
did sell the ring, and what of that? Isn't madame's ring
her own? She is obliged to turn it into money, since you
won't give her any. If I were she, I would sell the whole
house! The whole house, do you hear? It distresses me
beyond everything to see her going about as naked as Saint
John the Baptist!'</p>

<p>Mouret now began to keep a close watch at all times.
He locked up the cupboards and drawers, and kept the keys
in his own possession. Whenever Rose went out he would
look at her hands distrustfully, and even feel at her pockets if
he saw any suspicious swelling beneath her skirt. He brought
certain articles back from the second-hand dealer's and
restored them to their places, dusting and wiping them
ostentatiously in Marthe's presence in order to remind her of
what he called Rose's thefts. He never directly accused his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
wife. There was a cut-glass water-bottle which he turned
into a special instrument of torture. Rose, having sold it for
twenty sous, had pretended to Mouret that it was broken.
But now he made her bring it and put it on the table at every
meal. One day, at lunch, she quite lost her temper over it,
and purposely let it fall.</p>

<p>'There, sir, it's really broken this time, isn't it?' she
cried, laughing in his face.</p>

<p>As he threatened to dismiss her, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>'You had better! I've been in your service for five-and-twenty
years. If I went madame would go with me!'</p>

<p>Marthe, reduced to extremities and egged on by Rose and
Olympe, at last rebelled. She was desperately in want of five
hundred francs. For the last week Olympe had been crying
and sobbing, asserting that if she could not get five hundred
francs by the end of the month one of the bills which had
been endorsed by Abbé Faujas would be published in one of
the Plassans newspapers. The threatened publication of
this bill, this terrible threat which she did not quite understand,
threw Marthe into a state of dreadful alarm, and she
resolved to dare everything. In the evening, as they were
going to bed, she asked Mouret for the five hundred francs,
and when he looked at her in amazement she began to
speak of the fifteen years which she had spent behind a
counter at Marseilles, with a pen behind her ear like a clerk.</p>

<p>'We made the money together,' she said; 'and it belongs
to us both. I want five hundred francs.'</p>

<p>Mouret thereupon broke his long maintained silence in
the most violent fashion, and all his old raillery burst forth
again.</p>

<p>'Five hundred francs!' he cried. 'Do you want them
for your priest? I play the simpleton now and keep my
peace for fear I might say too much; but you must not
imagine that you can go on for ever making a fool of me!
Five hundred francs! Why not say the whole house? The
whole house certainly does seem to belong to him! He
wants some money, does he? And he has told you to ask
me for it? I might be among a lot of robbers in a wood
instead of being in my own home! I shall have my very
handkerchief stolen out of my pocket before long! I'll be
bound that if I were to go and search his room I should find
his drawers full of my property. There are seven pairs
of my socks missing, four or five shirts, and three pairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
of pants. I was going over the things yesterday. Everything
I have is disappearing, and I shan't have anything left
very soon! No, not a single sou will I give you, not a single
sou!'</p>

<p>'I want five hundred francs; half of the money belongs
to me,' Marthe tranquilly replied.</p>

<p>For a whole hour Mouret stormed and fumed and repeated
the same reproaches. His wife was no longer the same, he
said. He did not know her now. Before the priest's arrival,
she had loved him and obeyed him and looked after the house.
Those who set her to act in opposition to him must be very
wicked persons. Then his voice grew thick, and he let himself
fall into a chair, broken down and as weak as a child.</p>

<p>'Give me the key of your desk!' said Marthe.</p>

<p>He got up from his chair and gathered his strength together
for a last cry of protest.</p>

<p>'You want to strip me of everything, eh? to leave your
children with nothing but straw for a bed? You won't even
leave us a loaf of bread? Well! well! clear out everything,
and send for Rose to fill her apron! There's the key!'</p>

<p>He threw the key at Marthe and she placed it under her
pillow. She was quite pale after this quarrel, the first violent
quarrel that she had ever had with her husband. She got
into bed, but Mouret passed the night in an easy-chair. Towards
morning Marthe heard him sobbing. She would then
have given him back the key, if he had not wildly rushed into
the garden, though it was still pitch dark.</p>

<p>Peace again seemed to be re-established between them.
The key of the desk remained hanging upon a nail near the
mirror. Marthe, who was quite unaccustomed to the sight
of large sums, felt a sort of fear of the money. She was very
bashful and shamefaced at first whenever she went to open
the drawer in which Mouret always kept some ten thousand
francs in cash to pay for his purchases of wine. She strictly
confined herself to taking only what was necessary. Olympe,
too, gave her the most excellent advice, and told her that now
she had the key she ought to be careful and economical; and,
indeed, seeing the trembling nervousness which she exhibited
at the sight of the hoard of money, she ceased for some time
to speak to her of the Besançon debts.</p>

<p>Mouret meantime relapsed into his former moody silence.
Serge's admission to the Seminary had been another severe
blow to him. His friends of the Cours Sauvaire, the retired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
traders who promenaded there regularly between four o'clock
and six, began to feel very uneasy about him, when they saw
him arrive with his arms swaying about and his face wearing
a stupefied expression. He hardly made any reply to their
remarks and seemed a prey to some incurable disease.</p>

<p>'He's breaking up; he's breaking up,' they murmured to
each other; 'and he's only forty-four; it's scarcely credible.
He will end by having softening of the brain.'</p>

<p>Mouret no longer seemed to hear the malicious allusions
which were made before him. If he was questioned directly
about Abbé Faujas, he coloured slightly as he replied that the
priest was an excellent tenant and paid his rent with great
punctuality. When his back was turned, the retired shopkeepers
grinned as they sat and basked in the sun on one of
the seats on the Cours.</p>

<p>'Well, after all, he is only getting what he deserves,' said
a retired almond-dealer. 'You remember how hotly he stood
up for the priest, how he sang his praises in the four corners
of Plassans; but when one talks to him on that subject now
rather an odd expression comes over his face.'</p>

<p>These worthy gentlemen then regaled themselves with
certain scandalous stories which they whispered into each
other's ears, passing them on in this way from one end of the
bench to the other.</p>

<p>'Well,' said a master-tanner in a half whisper, 'there
isn't much pluck about Mouret; if I were in his place I would
soon show the priest the door.'</p>

<p>Thereupon they all repeated that Mouret was certainly a
very timid fellow, he who had formerly jeered so much at
those husbands who allowed their wives to lead them by the
nose.</p>

<p>These stories, however, in spite of the persistence with
which certain persons kept them afloat, never got beyond a
particular set of idle gossiping people, and the reason which
the Curé himself gave for not taking up his residence at the
parsonage, namely, his liking for the Mourets' beautiful garden,
where he could read his breviary in such perfect peace,
was generally accepted as the true one. His great piety, his
ascetic life and his contempt for all the frivolities and coquetries
which other priests allowed themselves placed him beyond
suspicion. The members of the Young Men's Club accused
Abbé Fenil of trying to ruin him. All the new part of the
town was on his side, and it was only the Saint-Marc quarter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
that was against him, its aristocratic inhabitants treating him
with great reserve whenever they met him in Monseigneur
Rousselot's saloons. However, in spite of his popularity, he
shook his head when old Madame Rougon told him that he
might now dare everything.</p>

<p>'Nothing is quite safe and solid yet,' he said. 'I am not
sure of anyone. The least touch might bring the whole
edifice toppling down.'</p>

<p>Marthe had been causing him anxiety for some time past.
He felt that he was incapable of calming the fever of
devotion which was raging within her. She escaped his
control and disobeyed him, and advanced further than he
wished her to do. He was afraid lest this woman, this much-respected
patroness, who was so useful, might yet bring about
his ruin. There was a fire burning within her which seemed
to discolour her flesh, and redden her eyes and make them
heavy. It was like an ever-growing disease, an infatuation
of her whole being, that was gradually weakening her heart
and brain. She often seemed to lapse into some ecstatic
trance, her hands were shaken by a nervous trembling, and a
dry cough occasionally shook her from head to foot without
consciousness apparently on her part of how it was rending
her. The Curé then showed himself sterner to her than
before, tried to crush the passion which was dawning within
her, and even forbade her to come to Saint-Saturnin's.</p>

<p>'The church is very cold,' he said, 'and you cough so
much there. I don't want you to do anything to make yourself
worse.'</p>

<p>She protested that there was nothing the matter with her
beyond a slight irritation of the throat, but at last she yielded
and accepted his prohibition as a well-deserved punishment
which closed the doors of heaven upon her. She wept,
believed that she was damned, and dragged herself listlessly
through the blank weary days; and then, in spite of herself,
like a woman returning to some forbidden love, when Friday
came she humbly glided into Saint-Michael's chapel and laid
her burning brow against the woodwork of the confessional-box.
She did not speak a word, but simply knelt there, completely
crushed, quite overwhelmed. At this Abbé Faujas,
who was greatly irritated, treated her as harshly as though
she was some unworthy woman, and hastily ordered her away.
Then she left the church, feeling happy and consoled.</p>

<p>The priest was afraid of the effect of the gloomy darkness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
of Saint-Michael's chapel. He spoke upon the subject to
Doctor Porquier, who persuaded Marthe to go to confession
at the little oratory of the Home of the Virgin in the suburb.
Abbé Faujas promised to be there to hear her every other
Saturday. This oratory, which had been established in a
large whitewashed room with four big windows, was bright
and cheerful, and would, he thought, have a calming effect
upon the excited imagination of his penitent. There, he
thought, he would be able to bring her under control, reduce
her to obedience, without possible fear of any scandal. As
a guard against all calumnious gossip, he asked his mother to
accompany Marthe, and while he confessed the latter Madame
Faujas remained outside the door. As the old lady did not
like to waste her time, she used to take her knitting with her
and work away at a stocking.</p>

<p>'My dear child,' she often said to Marthe, as they were returning
together to the Rue Balande, 'I could hear very well
what Ovide was saying to you to-day. You don't seem to be
able to please him. You can't care for him. Ah! I wish I
were in your place to be able to kiss his feet! I shall grow
to hate you, if you go on causing him nothing but annoyance.'</p>

<p>Marthe bent her head. She felt deep shame in Madame
Faujas's presence. She did not like her, she felt jealous of
her at finding her always coming between herself and the
priest. The old lady's dark eyes, too, troubled her when they
constantly bent upon her, full as they seemed of strange and
disquieting thoughts.</p>

<p>Marthe's weak state of health sufficed to account for
her meetings with Abbé Faujas at the oratory of the Home
of the Virgin. Doctor Porquier stated that she went there
simply in obedience to his orders, and the promenaders on the
Cours were vastly amused by this saying of the doctor's.</p>

<p>'Well, all the same,' remarked Madame Paloque to her
husband one day, as she watched Marthe going down to the
Rue Balande, accompanied by Madame Faujas, 'I should
like to be in some corner and watch the vicar and his sweetheart.
It is very amusing to hear her talk of her bad cold!
As though a bad cold was any reason why one shouldn't make
one's confession in church! I have had colds, but I never
made them an excuse for shutting myself up in a little chapel
with a priest.'</p>

<p>'It is very wrong of you to interfere in Abbé Faujas's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
affairs,' the judge replied to his wife. 'I have been spoken
to about him. He is a man with whom we must keep on
good terms, and you will prevent us from doing so; you are
too spiteful.'</p>

<p>'Stuff!' she retorted angrily; 'they have trampled me
under foot and I will let them know who I am! Your Abbé
Faujas is a big imbecile! Don't you suppose that Abbé Fenil
would be very grateful to me if I could catch the vicar and
his sweetheart? Ah! he would give a great deal to have a
scandal like that! Just you leave me alone; you don't
understand anything about such matters.'</p>

<p>A fortnight later, Madame Paloque watched Marthe go out
on the Saturday. She was standing ready dressed, hiding
her hideous face behind her curtains, but keeping watch over
the street through a hole in the muslin. When the two
women disappeared round the corner of the Rue Taravelle,
she sniggered, and leisurely drawing on her gloves went quietly
on to the Place of the Sub-Prefecture, and walked slowly
round it. As she passed in front of Madame de Condamin's
little house, she thought for a moment of going in and taking
her with her, but she reflected that the other might, perhaps,
have some scruples. And, all considered, it was better she
should be without witnesses, and manage the business by
herself.</p>

<p>'I have given them time,' she thought, after a quarter of
an hour's promenade. 'I think I may present myself now.'</p>

<p>Thereupon she quickened her pace. She frequently went
to the Home of the Virgin to discuss the accounts with
Trouche, but that day, instead of repairing to the secretary's
office, she went straight along the corridor towards the
oratory. Madame Faujas was quietly knitting on a chair in
front of the door.</p>

<p>The judge's wife had foreseen that obstacle, and went
straight on to the door with the hasty manner of a person
who has important business on hand. But before she could
reach out her hand to turn the handle the old lady had
risen from her chair and pushed her aside with extraordinary
energy.</p>

<p>'Where are you going?' she asked in her blunt peasant-woman's
tones.</p>

<p>'I am going where I have business,' Madame Paloque
replied, her arm smarting and her face convulsed with anger.
'You are an insolent, brutish woman! Let me pass! I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the treasurer of the Home of the Virgin, and I have a right
to go anywhere here I want.'</p>

<p>Madame Faujas, who stood leaning against the door,
straightened her spectacles upon her nose, and with unruffled
tranquillity resumed her knitting.</p>

<p>'Well,' she said bluntly, 'you can't go in there.'</p>

<p>'Can't, indeed! And may I ask why?'</p>

<p>'Because I don't wish that you should.'</p>

<p>The judge's wife felt that her plan was frustrated, and she
almost choked with spleen and anger. She was positively
frightful to look at as she gasped and stammered:</p>

<p>'I don't know who you are, and I don't know what you are
doing here. If I were to call out, I could have you arrested,
for you have struck me. There must be some great wickedness
going on at the other side of that door for you to have
been put there to keep people from entering. I belong to the
house, I tell you! Let me pass, or I shall call for help.'</p>

<p>'Call for anyone you like,' replied the old lady, shrugging
her shoulders. 'I have told you that you shall not go in,
that I won't let you. How am I to know that you belong to
the house? But it makes no difference whether you do or you
don't. No one can go in. I won't let them.'</p>

<p>Thereupon Madame Paloque lost all control of herself,
raised her voice, and shrieked out:</p>

<p>'I have no occasion to go in now! I have learnt quite
sufficient! You are Abbé Faujas's mother, are you not?
This is a very decent and pretty part for you to be playing!
I wouldn't enter the room now; I wouldn't mix myself up
with all this wickedness!'</p>

<p>Madame Faujas laid her knitting upon the chair, and,
bending slightly forward, gazed with glistening eyes through
her spectacles at Madame Paloque, holding her hands the
while a little in front of her, as though she were about to
spring upon the angry woman and silence her. She was,
indeed, going to throw herself forward, when the door suddenly
opened and Abbé Faujas appeared on the threshold.
He was in his surplice and looked very stern.</p>

<p>'Well, mother,' he asked, 'what is going on here?'</p>

<p>The old lady bent her head, and stepped back like a dog
that is taking its place at its master's heels.</p>

<p>'Ah! is it you, dear Madame Paloque?' the Curé continued;
'do you want to speak to me?'</p>

<p>By a supreme effort of will, the judge's wife forced her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
face into a smile. She answered the priest in a tone that was
terrible in its amiability and mingled irony.</p>

<p>'Ah! you were inside were you, your reverence? If I
had known that, I would not have insisted upon entering.
But I want to see the altar-cloth, which must, I think, be
getting into a bad condition. I am a careful superintendent
here, you know, and I keep an eye upon all these little details.
But, of course, if you are engaged in the oratory, I wouldn't
think of disturbing you. Pray go on with what you are
doing; the house is yours. If madame had only just dropped
me a word, I would have left her quietly to continue guarding
you from being disturbed.'</p>

<p>Madame Faujas allowed a growl to escape her, but a
glance from her son reduced her to silence.</p>

<p>'Come in, I beg you,' he said; 'you won't disturb me in
the least. I was confessing Madame Mouret, who is not very
well. Come in, by all means. The altar-cloth might very
well be changed, I think.'</p>

<p>'Oh, no! I will come some other time,' Madame Paloque
replied. 'I am quite distressed to have interrupted you.
Pray go on, your reverence, pray go on!'</p>

<p>Notwithstanding her protestations, however, she entered
the room. While she was examining the altar-cloth with
Marthe, the priest began to chide his mother in a low voice:</p>

<p>'Why did you prevent her coming in, mother? I never
told you to allow no one to enter.'</p>

<p>She gazed straight in front of her with her obstinate
determined glance. 'She would have had to walk over my
body before she got inside,' she muttered.</p>

<p>'But why?'</p>

<p>'Because&mdash;&mdash;. Listen to me, Ovide; don't be angry;
you know that it pains me to see you angry. You told me to
accompany our landlady here, didn't you? Well, I thought
you wanted me to stop inquisitive people's curiosity. So I
took my seat out here, and no one should have entered, be
sure of that.'</p>

<p>But the priest caught hold of his mother's hands and
shook her, exclaiming:</p>

<p>'Why, mother, you couldn't have supposed&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I suppose nothing,' she replied, with sublime indifference.
'You are free to do whatever pleases you. You are my child;
I would steal for you, I would.'</p>

<p>The priest was no longer listening to her. He had let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
her hands drop, and, as he gazed at her, he seemed to be lost
in reflections, which made his face look sterner and more
austere than ever.</p>

<p>'No, never!' he exclaimed with lofty pride. 'You are
greatly mistaken, mother. It is only the chaste who are
powerful.'</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="XVI" id="XVI">XVI</a></h3>


<p>At seventeen years of age, Désirée still retained the child-like
laugh of an 'innocent.' She was now a fine, tall girl,
plump and well-developed, with the arms and shoulders of a
full-grown woman. She grew like a healthy plant, happy in
her growth, and quite untouched by the unhappiness which
was wrecking and saddening the house.</p>

<p>'Why do you never laugh?' she cried to her father one
day. 'Come and have a game at skipping! It's such fun!'</p>

<p>She had taken possession of one of the garden-beds, which
she dug, planted with vegetables, and carefully watered. The
hard work delighted her. Then she desired to have some
fowls, which devoured her vegetables and which she scolded
with motherly tenderness. With these occupations of hers,
gardening and fowl-keeping, she made herself dreadfully
dirty.</p>

<p>'She's perfectly filthy!' cried Rose. 'I won't have her
coming into my kitchen any more; she dirties everything!
It is no use your trying to keep her neatly dressed, madame.
If I were you I should just let her mess about as she likes.'</p>

<p>Marthe, now ever preoccupied, no longer took care even
that Désirée should change her under-linen regularly. The
girl sometimes wore the same chemise for three weeks
together; her stockings fell over her shoes, which were sadly
worn down at the heels, and her tattered skirts hung about her
like a beggar's rags. Mouret was one day obliged to take up a
needle himself, for the girl's dress was torn behind from top
to bottom. She, however, laughed gleefully at her nakedness,
at her hair that fell over her shoulders, and at her black
hands and dirty face.</p>

<p>Marthe came to feel a sort of disgust of her. When she
returned home from mass, still retaining in her hair the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
vague perfume of the church, she quite shuddered at the
strong scent of earth which exhaled from her daughter. She
sent her into the garden again immediately lunch was
over. She could not bear to have her near her, distressed,
disquieted as she was by the girl's robust vigour and clear
laugh, which seemed to find amusement in everything.</p>

<p>'Oh, dear! how wearisome the child is!' she murmured
sometimes, with an air of nerveless lassitude.</p>

<p>As Mouret heard her complain, he exclaimed in an impulse
of anger:</p>

<p>'If she's in your way, we will turn her out of the house, as
we have done the other two.'</p>

<p>'Indeed, I should be very glad if she were to go away,'
Marthe answered unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>One afternoon, about the end of the summer, Mouret was
alarmed at no longer being able to hear Désirée, who, a few
minutes previously, had been making a tremendous noise at
the bottom of the garden. He ran to see what had happened
to her, and found her lying on the ground. She had fallen
from a ladder on to which she had climbed to gather some
figs: fortunately the box-plants had broken the force of her
fall. Mouret, in a great fright, lifted her up in his arms and
called for assistance. He thought she was dead; but she
quickly came to herself, declared that she was none the worse
for the accident, and wanted to climb the ladder again.</p>

<p>Marthe, however, had meantime come into the garden.
When she heard Désirée laugh she seemed quite annoyed.</p>

<p>'That child will kill me one of these days,' she exclaimed.
'She doesn't know what to invent to alarm me. I'm
sure that she threw herself down on purpose. I can't
endure it any longer. I shall shut myself up in my own
room, or go out in the morning and not return till evening.
Yes, you may laugh, you great goose! To think that I am
the mother of such a ninny! You are making me pay for it
very dearly!'</p>

<p>'Yes, that she is!' cried Rose, who had run down from
the kitchen; 'she's a great burden, and, unfortunately, there's
no chance of our ever being able to get her married.'</p>

<p>Mouret looked at them and listened with a pang at the
heart. He said nothing, but stayed with the girl at the
bottom of the garden, and there they remained chatting
affectionately till nightfall. The next day, Marthe and Rose
were away from the house the whole morning. They went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
to hear mass at a chapel, a league from Plassans, dedicated
to Saint-Januarius, whither all the pious folks of the town
made a pilgrimage on that particular day. When they
returned, the cook hastily served up a cold lunch. Marthe
went on eating for a few minutes before she noticed that her
daughter was not at table.</p>

<p>'Isn't Désirée hungry?' she asked. 'Why hasn't she
come to lunch?'</p>

<p>'Désirée is no longer here,' answered Mouret, who left
his food almost untouched upon his plate; 'I took her this
morning to her nurse at Saint-Eutrope.'</p>

<p>Marthe laid down her fork, and turned a little pale,
seeming both surprised and hurt.</p>

<p>'You might have consulted me,' she said.</p>

<p>Her husband, without making any direct reply, continued:</p>

<p>'She is all right with her nurse. The good woman is very
fond of her, and will look well after her, and the child will no
longer be in your way, and everyone will be happy.'</p>

<p>Then, as his wife said nothing, he added:</p>

<p>'If the house is not yet sufficiently quiet for you, just tell
me, and I will go away myself.'</p>

<p>She half rose from her seat, and a light glistened in her
eyes. Mouret had wounded her so cruelly that she stretched
out her hand as though she were going to throw the water-bottle
at his head. In her long-submissive nature angry
promptings were now being fanned into life, and she was
growing to hate this man who was ever prowling round her.
She made a show of eating again, but she said nothing
further about her daughter. Mouret had folded his napkin,
and remained sitting in front of her, listening to the sound
of her fork, and casting lingering glances round the dining-room,
which had once been so merry with the chatter of the
children, but was now so empty and mournful. The room
seemed to him to be quite chilly, and tears were mounting to
his eyes when Marthe called to Rose to bring in the dessert.</p>

<p>'You must be very hungry, I should think, madame,' said
the cook, as she put a plateful of fruit upon the table. 'We
had quite a long walk; and if the master, instead of playing
the pagan, had come with us, he would not have left you to
eat the mutton all by yourself.'</p>

<p>Then she changed the plates, without pausing in her
chatter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>'It is very pretty is that chapel of Saint-Januarius, but it
is too small. Did you see that the ladies who came late were
obliged to kneel down outside on the grass, in the open air?
I can't understand why Madame de Condamin came in a
carriage. There's no merit in making the pilgrimage if you
come like that. We spent a delightful morning, didn't we,
madame?'</p>

<p>'Yes, a very delightful morning,' Marthe replied. 'Abbé
Mousseau, who preached, was very affecting.'</p>

<p>When Rose in her turn noticed Désirée's absence and
learnt of the girl's departure, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Well, really, it was a very good idea of the master's!
She was always walking off with my saucepans to water her
plants. We shall be able to have a little peace now.'</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed,' said Marthe, who was cutting a pear.</p>

<p>Mouret was almost choking. He rose and left the dining-room
without paying any attention to Rose, who cried out to
him that the coffee would be ready directly. Marthe, now left
alone in the room, quietly finished her pear.</p>

<p>Just as the cook was bringing the coffee, Madame Faujas
came downstairs.</p>

<p>'Go in,' Rose said to her; 'you will be company for
madame, and you can have the master's coffee, for he has
just rushed off like a madman.'</p>

<p>The old lady sat down in Mouret's place.</p>

<p>'I thought you did not take coffee,' she remarked as she
put some sugar into her cup.</p>

<p>'No, indeed, she didn't do so when the master kept the
purse,' interposed Rose. 'But madame would be very silly
now to deny herself what she likes.'</p>

<p>They talked for a good hour together, and Marthe ended
by relating all her troubles to Madame Faujas, telling her how
her husband had just inflicted a most painful scene upon her
on account of her daughter, whom he had removed to her
nurse's in a sudden pet. She defended herself, and told
Madame Faujas that she was really very fond of the girl, and
should go to fetch her back before long.</p>

<p>'Well, she was rather noisy,' Madame Faujas remarked.
'I have often pitied you. My son was thinking about giving
up going into the garden to read his breviary. She almost
distracted him with the noise she made.'</p>

<p>From that day forward Marthe and Mouret took their
meals in silence. The autumn was very damp, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
dining-room looked intensely melancholy with only two covers
laid, one at each end of the big table. The corners were
dark, and a chill seemed to fall from the ceiling. As Rose
would say, it looked as though a funeral were going on.</p>

<p>'Well, indeed,' she often exclaimed, as she brought the
plates into the room, 'you couldn't make much less noise,
sir, however you tried! There isn't much danger of your
wearing the skin of your tongue off! Do try to be a little
livelier, sir! You look as though you were following a corpse
to the grave!&mdash;You will end by making madame quite ill. It
is bad for the health to eat without speaking.'</p>

<p>When the first frosts came, Rose, who sought in every
way to oblige Madame Faujas, offered her the use of her
cooking-stove. The old lady had begun by bringing down
kettles to get her water boiled, as she had no fire, she
said, and the Abbé was in a hurry to shave. Then she
borrowed some flat-irons, begged the use of some saucepans,
asked for the loan of the dutch-oven to cook some
mutton, and finally, in the end, as she had no conveniently
arranged fireplace upstairs, she accepted Rose's repeated
offers, and the cook lighted her a fire of vine branches, big
enough to roast a whole sheep, in the kitchen.</p>

<p>'Don't show any diffidence about it,' she said, as she
herself turned the leg of mutton round; 'the kitchener is a
large one, isn't it? and big enough for us both. I don't know
how you've been able to do your cooking upstairs as long as
you have, with only that wretched iron stove there. I should
have been afraid of falling down in an apoplectic fit myself.
Monsieur Mouret ought to know better than to let a set of
rooms without any kitchen. You must be very enduring kind
of people, and very easily satisfied.'</p>

<p>Thus Madame Faujas gradually began to cook her lunch
and dinner in the Mourets' kitchen. On the first few occasions
she provided her own coal and oil and spices. But afterwards,
when she forgot to bring any article with her, Rose would not
allow her to go upstairs for it, but insisted upon supplying the
deficiency from the house stores.</p>

<p>'Oh, there's some butter there! The little bit which you
will take with the tip of your knife won't ruin us. You
know very well that everything here is at your service.
Madame would be quite angry with me if I didn't make you
at home here.'</p>

<p>A close intimacy now sprang up between Rose and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Madame Faujas. The cook was delighted to have some one
always at hand who was willing to listen to her while she
stirred her sauces. She got on extremely well with the
priest's mother, whose print dresses and rough face and
unpolished demeanour put her almost on a footing of equality.
They sat chatting together for hours before the fireplace, and
Madame Faujas soon gained complete sway in the kitchen,
though she still maintained her impenetrable attitude, and
only said what she chose to say, while contriving to worm
out all that she wanted to know. She settled the Mourets'
dinner, tasted the dishes which she had arranged they should
have, and Rose herself often made savoury little luxuries for
the Abbé's delectation, such as sugared apples or rice-cakes or
fritters. The provisions of the two establishments often got
mixed together, mistakes were made with the different pans,
the two dinners being so intermingled that Rose would cry
out with a laugh:</p>

<p>'Tell me, madame, are these poached eggs yours? Really,
I don't know. Upon my word, it would be much better if you
were all to dine together!'</p>

<p>It was on All Saints Day that Abbé Faujas lunched for
the first time in the Mourets' dining-room. He was in a great
hurry, as he had to return to Saint-Saturnin's at once, and
so, to give him as much time as possible, Marthe asked him
to sit down at their table, saying that it would save his
mother from climbing a couple of flights of stairs. A week
later it had become a regular thing; the Faujases came
downstairs at every meal and took their seats at table, just as
if they were entering a restaurant. For the first few days
their provisions were cooked and served separately, but Rose
declared this was a very silly arrangement, that she could
easily cook for four persons, and that she would arrange it all
with Madame Faujas.</p>

<p>'Pray don't thank me,' she said to the Abbé and his
mother; 'it is a kindness on your part to come down and
keep madame company. You will cheer her up a little. I
scarcely dare go into the dining-room now; it is just like
going into the chamber of death. It quite frightens me, it
feels so desolate. If the master chooses to go on sulking, he
will have to do so all by himself.'</p>

<p>They kept up a roaring fire, the room was very warm, and
the winter proved a delightful one. Rose had never before
taken such pains to lay the tablecloth nicely. She placed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
reverence's chair near the stove, so that he might have his
back to the fire. She paid particular attention to his glass
and his knife and fork, she took care that whenever the
slightest stain made its appearance upon the cloth it should
not be put on his side, and she paid him numberless other
delicate little attentions.</p>

<p>When she had prepared any dish of which he was particularly
fond, she gave him notice so that he might reserve
himself for it; though sometimes, on the other hand, she
made a surprise of it for him, and brought it into the room
under a cover, smiling at the inquisitive glances directed
towards it, and exclaiming with an air of triumph:</p>

<p>'This is for his reverence! It is a wild-duck stuffed with
olives, just what he is so fond of. Give his reverence the
breast, madame. I cooked it specially for him.'</p>

<p>Marthe carved the duck, and with beseeching looks pressed
the choicest morsels upon the Abbé. She always helped him
the first, and searched the dish for him, while Rose bent over
her and pointed out what she thought the best parts. They
occasionally even had little disputes as to the superiority of
this or that part of a fowl or rabbit. Then, too, Rose used to
push an embroidered hassock under the priest's feet, while
Marthe insisted that he should always have his bottle of
Bordeaux and his roll, specially ordering one of the latter for
him from the baker every day.</p>

<p>'We can never do too much for you,' said Rose, when the
Abbé expressed his thanks. 'Who should be well looked
after, if it isn't good kind hearts like yours? Don't you
trouble about it, the Lord will pay your debt for you.'</p>

<p>Madame Faujas smiled at all these flattering civilities as
she sat at table opposite her son. She was beginning to feel
quite fond of Marthe and Rose. She considered their adoration
only natural, and thought it a great happiness for them
to be allowed to cast themselves in this way at the feet of
her idol. It was really she with her square head and peasant
manner who presided over the table, eating slowly but plentifully,
noticing everything that happened without once setting
down her fork, and taking care that Marthe should play the
part of servant to her son, at whom she was constantly
gazing with an expression of content. She never opened her
lips except to make known in as few words as possible
the Abbé's various tastes or to over-rule the polite refusals
in which he still occasionally indulged. Sometimes she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
shrugged her shoulders and pushed him with her foot.
Wasn't everything on the table at his service? He might
eat the whole contents of the dish, if he liked, and the others
would be quite happy to nibble their dry bread and look at
him.</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas himself, however, seemed quite indifferent to
all the tender care which was lavished upon him. Of a very
frugal disposition and a quick eater, his mind always occupied
with other matters, he was frequently quite unconscious
of the dainties which were specially reserved for him. He
had yielded to his mother's entreaties in consenting to join
the Mourets, but the only satisfaction he experienced in the
dining-room on the ground-floor was the pleasure of being set
entirely free from the everyday cares of life. He manifested
unruffled serenity, gradually grew accustomed to seeing his
least wish anticipated and fulfilled, and ceased to manifest any
surprise or express any thanks, lording it haughtily between
the mistress of the house and the cook, who kept anxious
watch over the slightest motions of his stern face.</p>

<p>Mouret sat opposite his wife, quite forgotten and unnoticed.
He let his hands rest upon the edge of the table, and waited,
like a child, till Marthe should be willing to attend to him.
She helped him the last, scantily, and to whatever might
happen to be left. Rose stood behind her and warned her
whenever by mistake she was going to give her husband some
of the more delicate morsels in the dish.</p>

<p>'No, no; not that. The master likes the head, you know.
He enjoys sucking the little bones.'</p>

<p>Mouret, snubbed and slighted, ate his food with a sort of
shame, as though he was subsisting unworthily on other
people's bounty. He could see Madame Faujas watching him
keenly as he cut his bread. He kept his eyes fixed on the
bottle for a whole minute, full of doubtful hesitation, before
he dare venture to help himself to wine. Once he made a
mistake and took a little of the priest's choice Bordeaux.
There was a tremendous fuss made about it, and for a whole
month afterwards Rose reproached him for those few drops
of wine. Whenever she made any sweet dish, she would say:</p>

<p>'I don't want the master to have any of that. He never
thinks anything I make nice. He once told me that an
omelet I had made was burnt, and then I said, "They shall be
burnt altogether for you." Don't give any of it to the master,
I beg you, madame.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>She also did all she could to worry and upset him. She
gave him cracked plates, contrived that one of the table legs
should come between his own, left shreds of the glass-cloth
clinging to his glass, and placed the bread and wine and salt
as far from him as possible. Mouret was the only one in the
family who liked mustard, and he used to go himself to the
grocers and buy canisters of it, which the cook promptly
caused to disappear, saying that they 'stank so.' The deprivation
of mustard spoilt his enjoyment of his meals. But
what made him still more miserable, and robbed him of all
appetite, was his expulsion from his own seat, which he had
always previously occupied, in front of the window, which was
now given to the priest, as being the pleasantest in the room.
Mouret had to sit with his face towards the door, and he felt
as though he were eating amongst strangers, now that he
could not at each mouthful cast a glance at his fruit-trees.</p>

<p>Marthe was not so bitter against him as Rose was. She
treated him at first like a poor relation, whose presence is
just tolerated, and then gradually grew to ignore him, scarcely
ever addressing a remark to him, and acting as though Abbé
Faujas alone had the right to give orders in the house.
Mouret, however, showed no inclination to rebel. He occasionally
exchanged a few polite phrases with the priest,
though he generally ate in perfect silence, and only replied to
the cook's attacks by looking at her. He always finished
before any of the others, folded up his napkin tidily, and
then left the room, frequently before the dessert was placed
upon the table.</p>

<p>Rose alleged that he was bursting with anger, and when
she gossiped in the kitchen with Madame Faujas she discussed
his conduct freely.</p>

<p>'I know him very well; I've never been afraid of him.
Before you came madame used to tremble before him, for he
was always scolding and blustering and trying to appear very
terrible. He used to worry our lives out of us, always poking
about, never finding anything right, and trying to show us
that he was master. Now he is as docile as a lamb, isn't he?
It's just because madame has asserted herself. Ah! if he
weren't a coward, and weren't afraid of what might happen,
you would hear a pretty row. But he is afraid of your son;
yes, he is afraid of his reverence the Curé. Anyone would
say, to look at him, that he lost his senses every now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
then. But after all, as long as he doesn't bother us any
longer, he is welcome to act as he pleases; isn't he, madame?'</p>

<p>Madame Faujas replied that Monsieur Mouret seemed to
her to be a very worthy man, and that his only fault was his
lack of religion. But he would certainly adopt a better mode
of life in time, she said. The old lady was gradually making
herself mistress of the whole of the ground floor, going from
kitchen to dining-room as she pleased, and ever bustling
about in the hall and passages. When Mouret met her he
used to recall the day when the Faujases first arrived; when,
wearing that shabby black dress of hers, she had tenaciously
clung to her basket with both hands and poked her head inquisitively
into each room, with all the unruffled serenity of a
person inspecting some property for sale.</p>

<p>Since the Faujases had begun to take their meals downstairs
the Trouches were left in possession of the second floor.
They made a great deal of noise, and the constant moving of
furniture, the stamping of feet and the violent banging of doors,
were heard by those downstairs. Madame Faujas would then
uneasily raise her head in the midst of her gossiping in the
kitchen. Rose, for the sake of putting her at her ease, used
to say that poor Madame Trouche suffered a great deal of
pain. One night the Abbé, who had not yet gone to bed,
heard a strange commotion on the stairs. He left his room
with his candle in his hand, and saw Trouche, disgracefully
drunk, climbing up the stairs on his knees. He seized the sot
in his strong arms and threw him into his room. Olympe
was in bed there, quietly reading a novel and sipping a
glass of spirits and water that stood on a little table at the
bedside.</p>

<p>'Listen to me,' said Abbé Faujas, livid with rage; 'you
will pack up your things in the morning and take yourselves
off!'</p>

<p>'Why? What for?' asked Olympe, quite calmly; 'we
are very comfortable here.'</p>

<p>The priest sternly interrupted her.</p>

<p>'Hold your tongue! You are a wretched woman! You
have never tried to do anything but injure me. Our mother
was right; I ought never to have rescued you from your state
of wretchedness. I've just had to pick your husband up on
the stairs. It is disgraceful. Think of the scandal there
would be if he were to be seen in this state. You will go away
in the morning.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>Olympe sat up to sip her grog.</p>

<p>'No, no, indeed!' she said.</p>

<p>Trouche laughed. He was drunkenly merry, and fell
back into an armchair in a state of happy self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>'Don't let us quarrel,' he stammered. 'It is a mere
nothing; only a little giddiness. The air, which is very cold,
made me dizzy, that's all. And your streets in this confounded
town are so very confusing. I say, Faujas, there are
some very nice young fellows about here. There's Doctor
Porquier's son. You know Doctor Porquier, don't you?
Well, I meet the son at a café behind the gaol. It is kept by
a woman from Arles, a fine handsome woman with a dark
complexion.'</p>

<p>The priest crossed his arms and looked at him with a
terrible expression.</p>

<p>'No, really, Faujas, I assure you that it is quite wrong
of you to be angry with me. You know that I have been
well brought up, and that I know how to behave myself.
Why, in the day-time I wouldn't touch a drop of syrup for
fear of compromising you. Since I have been here I have
gone to my office just like a boy going to school, with slices
of bread and jam in a little basket. It's a very stupid sort of
life, I can assure you, and I only do it to be of service to you.
But at night, I'm not likely to be seen, and I can go about a
little. It does me good, and, in fact, I should die if I always
kept myself locked up here. There is no one in the streets,
you know. What funny streets they are, eh?'</p>

<p>'Sot!' growled the priest between his clenched teeth.</p>

<p>'You won't be friends, then? Well, that's very wrong
of you, old chap. I'm a jolly fellow myself, and I don't like
sour looks, and if what I do doesn't please you, I'll leave you
to get on with your pious ladies by yourself. That little Condamin
is the only decent one amongst them, and even she
doesn't come up to the café-keeper from Arles. Oh, yes!
you may roll your eyes about as much as you like. I can get
on quite well without you. See! would you like me to lend
you a hundred francs?'</p>

<p>He drew out a bundle of bank-notes and spread them on
his knees, laughing loudly as he did so. Then he swept
them under the Abbé's nose and threw them up in the
air. Olympe sprang out of bed, half naked, picked up the
notes and placed them under the bolster with an expression
of vexation. Abbé Faujas glanced around him with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
surprise. He saw bottles of liqueurs ranged all along the top
of the chest of drawers, a scarcely touched patty was on the
mantelpiece, and there were some sweetmeats in an old box.
The room was, indeed, full of recent purchases; dresses
thrown over the chairs, an open parcel of lace, a magnificent
new overcoat hanging from the window-catch, and a bearskin
rug spread out in front of the bed. By the side of Olympe's
glass of grog on the little table there also lay a small gold
lady's watch glittering in a porcelain tray.</p>

<p>'Whom have they been plundering, I wonder?' thought
the priest.</p>

<p>Then he recollected having seen Olympe kissing Marthe's
hands.</p>

<p>'You wretched people!' he cried; 'you have been
thieving!'</p>

<p>Trouche sprang up, but his wife pushed him down upon
the sofa. 'Keep quiet!' she said to him, 'go to sleep, you
need it.'</p>

<p>Then, turning to her brother, she continued:</p>

<p>'It is one o'clock, and you might let us go to sleep if you
have only disagreeable things to say. It is certainly wrong
of my husband to intoxicate himself, but that's no reason
why you should abuse him. We have already had several
explanations; this one must be the last, do you understand,
Ovide? We are brother and sister, are we not? Well, then,
as I have told you before, we must go halves. You gorge
yourself downstairs, you have all kinds of dainty dishes provided
for you, and you live a fat life between the landlady
and the cook. Well, you please yourself about that. We
don't go and look into your plate or try to pull the dainty
morsels out of your mouth. We let you manage your affairs
as you like. Very well then, just you leave us alone and
allow us the same liberty. I don't think I am asking anything
unreasonable.'</p>

<p>The priest made a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>'Oh yes, I understand,' she continued; 'you are afraid
lest we should compromise you in your schemes. The best
way to ensure our not doing so is to leave us in peace and
cease from worrying us. Ah! in spite of all your grand airs,
you are not so very clever. We have the same interests as
you have, we are all of the same family, and we might very
well hunt together. It would be much the best plan, if you
would only see it. But there, go to bed, now! I'll scold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
Trouche in the morning, and I'll send him to you and you
can give him your instructions.'</p>

<p>For a moment the priest, who was a little pale, remained
thinking; then, without another word, he left the room, and
Olympe resumed the perusal of her novel, while Trouche lay
snoring on the sofa.</p>

<p>The next morning, Trouche, who had recovered his wits,
had a long interview with Abbé Faujas. When he returned
to his wife, he informed her of the conditions upon which
peace had again been patched up.</p>

<p>'Listen to me, my dear,' Olympe replied. 'Give way to
him and do what he asks. Above all try to be useful to
him, since he gives you the chance of being so. I put a
bold face on the matter when he is here, but in my own
heart I know very well that he would turn us out into the
street like dogs if we pushed him too far, and I don't want to
have to go away. Are you sure that he will let us stay?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes; don't be afraid,' replied the secretary. 'He has
need of me, and he will leave us to feather our nest.'</p>

<p>From this time forward Trouche used to go out every
evening about nine o'clock, when the streets were quiet. He
told his wife that he went into the old quarter of the town
to further the Abbé's cause. Olympe was not at all jealous
of his nightly absences, and laughed heartily whenever he
brought her back some broad story. She preferred being left
quietly to herself, to sip her glass and nibble her cakes in
privacy, or to spend her long evenings snugly in bed,
devouring the old novels of a circulating-library which she
had discovered in the Rue Canquoin. Trouche used to come
back slightly under the influence of liquor, but he took off
his boots in the hall so as to make no noise as he went
upstairs. When he had drunk too much, and reeked of
tobacco and brandy, his wife would not let him get into bed,
but made him sleep on the sofa. If he became annoying, she
caught hold of him, looked him sternly in the face, and said:</p>

<p>'Ovide will hear you. Ovide is coming.'</p>

<p>At this he was as frightened as a child that is threatened
with a wolf, and went off to sleep, muttering excuses. In the
morning he dressed himself in serious, sedate fashion, wiped
from his face all the marks of the previous night's dissipation,
and put on a certain cravat, which gave him, he said, quite
the air of a parson. As he passed the cafés he bent his head
to the ground. At the Home of the Virgin he was held in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
great respect. Now and then, when the girls were playing
in the courtyard, he raised a corner of his curtain and glanced
at them with an affectation of fatherliness, though his eyes
glistened beneath their lowered lids.</p>

<p>The Trouches were still kept in check by Madame Faujas.
The mother and the daughter were perpetually quarrelling,
Olympe complaining that she was sacrificed to her brother,
and Madame Faujas treating her like a viper whom she ought
to have crushed to death in her cradle. Both grasping after the
same prey, they kept a close watch on one another, anxious to
know which would secure the larger share. Madame Faujas
wanted to obtain everything in the house, and she tried to
keep the very sweepings from Olympe's clutching fingers.
On seeing what large sums her daughter drew from Marthe,
she quite burst with anger. When her son shrugged his
shoulders at it like a man who despises such matters, and is
forced to close his eyes to them, she, on her side, had a
stormy explanation with her daughter, whom she branded as
a thief, as though the money had been taken from her own
pocket.</p>

<p>'There, mother, that will do!' cried Olympe impatiently.
'It isn't your purse, you know, that I have been lightening.
Besides, I have only been borrowing a little money; I don't
make other people keep me.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean, you wicked hussy?' gasped Madame
Faujas with indignation. 'Do you suppose that we don't pay
for our food? Ask the cook, and she will show you our
account book.'</p>

<p>Olympe broke out into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, that's very nice!' she cried; 'I know that
account book of yours! You pay for the radishes and butter,
don't you? Stay downstairs by all means, mother; stay
downstairs on the ground floor. I don't want to interfere
with your arrangements. But don't come up here and worry
me any more, or I shall make a row, and you know that
Ovide has forbidden any noise up here.'</p>

<p>At this Madame Faujas went downstairs muttering and
growling. The threat of making a disturbance always compelled
her to beat a retreat. Olympe began to sing jeeringly
as soon as her mother's back was turned. But whenever
she went down into the garden the other took her revenge,
keeping everlastingly at her heels, watching her hands, never
ceasing to play the spy upon her. She would not allow her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
in the kitchen or dining-room for a moment. She embroiled
her with Rose about a saucepan that had been borrowed and
never returned; but she did not dare to attempt to undermine
Marthe's friendship for her for fear of causing some
scandal which might prove prejudicial to the priest.</p>

<p>'Since you are so regardless of your own interests,' she
said to her son one day, 'I must look after them for you.
Make yourself easy. I shan't do anything foolish; but if I
were not here, your sister would snatch the very bread out of
your hands.'</p>

<p>Marthe had no notion of the drama that was being played
around her. To her the house simply seemed more lively
and cheerful, now that all these people thronged the hall
and the stairs and the passages. The place was as noisy as
an hotel, what with all the echoes of quarrelling, the banging
of doors, the free and independent life of each of the tenants,
and the flaming fire in the kitchen, where Rose seemed to
have a whole table d'hôte to provide for. There was a continual
procession of tradesmen to the house. Olympe, who
became very particular about her hands and refused to risk
spoiling them by washing plates and dishes, had everything
sent from a confectioner's in the Rue de la Banne, who
catered for the townspeople. Marthe smiled and said she
enjoyed the present bustle of the house. She now greatly
disliked being left alone, and felt the necessity of occupation
of some sort to allay the fever that was consuming her.</p>

<p>Mouret, however, to escape from all the racket, used to
shut himself up in a room on the first floor, which he called
his office. He had overcome his distaste for solitude; he
now scarcely ever went down into the garden, but kept
himself locked up from morning till night.</p>

<p>'I should very much like to know what he finds to do in
there,' said Rose to Madame Faujas. 'One can't hear him
move, and you might almost fancy he was dead. If he
wants to hide himself in that way, it must be because he is
doing something that's neither right nor proper; don't you
think so, eh?'</p>

<p>When the summer came round once more, the house grew
still livelier. Abbé Faujas received the guests of both the
sub-prefect and the presiding judge beneath the arbour at the
bottom of the garden. Rose, by Marthe's orders, purchased
a dozen rustic chairs, so that the visitors might enjoy the
fresh air without it being necessary to carry the dining-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
chairs hither and thither. It was now the regular thing for
the doors communicating with the little lane to remain open
every Tuesday afternoon, and the ladies and gentlemen came
to salute Abbé Faujas like friendly neighbours, the men often
in their slippers and with their coats carelessly unbuttoned,
and the ladies in straw hats and with skirts looped up
with pins. The visitors arrived one by one, and gradually
the two sets of guests found themselves mixing together,
gossiping and amusing themselves with perfect familiarity.</p>

<p>'Aren't you afraid,' said Monsieur Bourdeu to Monsieur
Rastoil one day, 'that these meetings with the sub-prefect's
friends may be ill advised? The general elections are
getting near.'</p>

<p>'Why should they be ill advised?' asked Monsieur
Rastoil. 'We don't go to the Sub-Prefecture; we keep on
neutral ground. Besides, my good friend, there is no
ceremony about the matter. I keep my linen jacket on, and
it's a mere private friendly visit. No one has any right to
pass judgment upon what I do at the back of my house. In
the front it's another matter. In the front we belong to the
public. When Monsieur Péqueur and I meet each other in
the streets we merely bow.'</p>

<p>'Monsieur Péqueur de Saulaies improves much on acquaintance,'
the ex-prefect ventured to remark after a short pause.</p>

<p>'Certainly, certainly,' replied the presiding judge; 'I am
delighted to have made his acquaintance. And what a worthy
man Abbé Faujas is! No, no; I have no fear of any slander
arising from our going to pay our respects to our excellent
neighbour.'</p>

<p>Since the general election had begun to be the subject of
conversation, Monsieur de Bourdeu had felt very uneasy. He
declared that it was the increasing warmth of the weather
that affected him; but he was frequently assailed with doubts
and scruples, which he confided to Monsieur Rastoil in order
that the latter might reassure him. However, politics were
never mentioned in the Mourets' garden. One afternoon,
Monsieur de Bourdeu, after vainly trying to devise some
means of bringing political matters forward, exclaimed
abruptly, addressing himself to Doctor Porquier:</p>

<p>'I say, doctor, have you seen the "Moniteur" this morning?
I see that the marquis has at last spoken! He uttered
just thirteen words; I counted them. Poor Lagrifoul! He
has made himself very ridiculous!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>Abbé Faujas raised his finger with an arch look. 'No
politics, gentlemen, no politics,' said he.</p>

<p>Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies was chatting with Monsieur
Rastoil, and they both pretended that they had not heard
what was said. Madame de Condamin smiled as she continued
her conversation with Abbé Surin.</p>

<p>'Aren't your surplices stiffened with a weak solution of
gum?' she inquired.</p>

<p>'Yes, madame, with a weak solution of gum,' replied the
young priest. 'Some laundresses use boiled starch, but it
spoils the material and is worthless.'</p>

<p>'Well,' rejoined the young woman, 'I never can get my
laundress to use gum for my petticoats.'</p>

<p>Thereupon Abbé Surin politely gave her the name and
address of his own laundress upon the back of one of his
visiting cards. Then the company chatted about dress and
the weather and the crops and the events of the week, spending
a delightful hour together; and there were also games of
shuttlecock in the alley. Abbé Bourrette frequently made
his appearance, and told in his enthusiastic manner divers
pious little stories to which Monsieur Maffre listened with the
greatest attention. Upon one occasion only had Madame
Delangre met Madame Rastoil there; they had treated each
other with the most scrupulous politeness, but in their faded
eyes still flashed the sparks of their old-time rivalry. Monsieur
Delangre for his part did not make himself too cheap,
and though the Paloques were constantly at the Sub-Prefecture,
they contrived to be absent when Monsieur
Péqueur des Saulaies went to make one of his neighbourly
calls upon Abbé Faujas. The judge's wife had been much
perplexed in mind ever since her unfortunate expedition to
the oratory at the Home of the Virgin. On the other hand,
the person who was oftenest to be seen in the garden was
certainly Monsieur de Condamin, who always wore the most
perfect fitting gloves, and came thither to make fun of the
company, telling fibs and indelicate stories with extraordinary
coolness and unconcern, and deriving a perfect fund of amusement
for the whole week from the little intrigues which he
scented out. This tall old buck, whose coat fitted so closely
to his slim figure, was devoted to youth; he scoffed at the
'old ones,' went off with the young ladies, and laughed gaily
in the snug little corners of the garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>'This way, youngsters!' he would say, with a smile, 'let
us leave the old ones together.'</p>

<p>One day he almost defeated Abbé Surin in a tremendous
battle at shuttlecock. He was very fond of plaguing young
people, and made a special victim of Monsieur Rastoil's son,
a simple young fellow, to whom he told the most prodigious
stories. He ended, indeed, by accusing him of making love
to his wife, and rolled his eyes about in such a terrible way,
that the wretched Séverin broke out into a perspiration from
very fear. The youth did, as it happened, actually fancy that
he was in love with Madame de Condamin, in whose presence
he behaved in a tender, simpering manner that extremely
amused her husband.</p>

<p>The Rastoil girls, for whom the conservator of rivers and
forests manifested all the gallantry of a young widower, also
supplied subjects of his raillery. Although they were
approaching their thirtieth birthdays, he spurred them on to
indulge in childish games, and spoke to them as though they
were yet schoolgirls. His great amusement was to gaze at
them when Lucien Delangre, the mayor's son, was present.
He would then take Doctor Porquier aside, and whisper in his
ear, alluding to the former entanglement between Monsieur
Delangre and Madame Rastoil:</p>

<p>'There's a young man there, Porquier, who is very much
embarrassed in his mind&mdash;&mdash;Is it Angéline or is it Aurélie
whom he ought to choose? Guess, if you can, and name, if
you dare.'</p>

<p>Meantime Abbé Faujas was very polite and amiable to all
his visitors, even to the terrible Condamin who caused so
much disquietude. He effaced himself as much as possible,
spoke but little, and allowed the rival sets of guests to
coalesce, seemingly experiencing the quiet satisfaction of a
host who is happy to be the means of bringing together a
number of distinguished people intended by nature to be
on good terms with one another. Marthe had upon two
occasions made her appearance, thinking that she would put
the visitors more at their ease by doing so; but it distressed
her to find the Abbé in the midst of so many people; she
much preferred to see him walking slowly and seriously in
the quiet of the arbour. The Trouches on their side had
resumed their Tuesday watchings behind their curtains, while
Madame Faujas and Rose craned their heads from the doorway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
and admired the graceful manner in which his reverence
received the chief people of Plassans.</p>

<p>'Ah, madame!' said the cook, 'it is very easy to see that
he is a distinguished man. Look at him bowing to the sub-prefect.
I admire his reverence the most; though, indeed,
the sub-prefect is a fine man. Why do you never go into
the garden to them? If I were you, I would put on a silk
dress and join them. You are his mother, you know,
after all.'</p>

<p>But the old peasant woman shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>'Oh! he isn't ashamed of me,' she said; 'but I should
be afraid of putting him out. I prefer to watch him from
here; and I enjoy it more.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I can understand that. Ah! you must be very
proud of him. He isn't a bit like Monsieur Mouret, who
nailed the door up, so that no one might open it. We never
had a visitor, there was never a dinner to be prepared for
anyone, and the garden was so desolate that it made one feel
quite frightened in the evenings. Monsieur Mouret would
certainly never have known how to receive visitors. He
always pulled a sour face if one ever happened to come by
chance. Don't you think, now, that he ought to take an
example from his reverence? If I were he, I should come
down and amuse myself in the garden with the others,
instead of shutting myself up all alone. I would take my
proper place. But there he is, shut up in his room, as
though he were afraid they would give him some nasty illness!
By the way, shall we go up sometime and try to find
out what he does?'</p>

<p>One Tuesday they did go upstairs together. The visitors
were very merry that afternoon, and the sound of their
laughter floated into the house through the open windows,
while a tradesman, who had brought a hamper of wine for
the Trouches, made a clatter on the second floor as he
collected the empty bottles together. Mouret was securely
locked up in his office.</p>

<p>'The key prevents me from seeing,' said Rose, who had
applied her eye to the key-hole.</p>

<p>'Wait a moment,' murmured Madame Faujas, and she
carefully turned the end of the key, which protruded slightly
through the lock. Mouret was sitting in the middle of the
room in front of a big empty table, covered with a thick layer
of dust. There was not a single paper nor book upon it. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
was lying back in his chair, his arms hanging listlessly beside
him while he gazed blankly into space. He sat perfectly
still, without the slightest movement.</p>

<p>The two women looked at him in silence, one after the
other.</p>

<p>'He has made me feel cold to the very marrow,' exclaimed
Rose, as they went downstairs again. 'Did you notice his
eyes? And what a filthy state the room is in! He hasn't
laid a pen on that desk for a couple of months past, and to
think that I fancied he spent all his time there writing.
Fancy him amusing himself like that&mdash;shutting himself up
all alone like a corpse, when the house is so bright and
cheerful!'</p>

<p>Marthe's health was causing Doctor Porquier much anxiety.
He still smiled in his pleasant way, and talked to her after the
manner of a fashionable medical man for whom disease never
has any existence, and who grants a consultation just as a
dressmaker fits on a new dress; but there was a certain twist
on his lips which indicated that 'dear madame' had something
more seriously wrong with her than a slight cough and
spitting of blood, as he tried to persuade her. He advised
her, now that the warm weather had come, to get a little
change of surroundings and occupation by taking an occasional
drive, without, however, over-fatiguing herself. In obedience
to the doctor's directions, Marthe, who was more and
more possessed by a vague feeling of anguish, and a need of
finding some occupation to assuage her nervous impatience,
started on a series of excursions to the neighbouring villages.
Twice a week she drove off, after luncheon, in an old refurbished
carriage, hired from a Plassans coachbuilder. She
generally drove some six or seven miles out, so as to get back
home by six o'clock. Her great desire was to induce Abbé
Faujas to go with her, and it was only in the hope of accomplishing
this that she had conformed with the doctor's
directions; but the Abbé, without distinctly refusing, always
excused himself on the ground that he was too busy to spare
the time, and Marthe was obliged to content herself with the
companionship of Olympe or Madame Faujas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>One afternoon as she was driving with Olympe towards
the village of Les Tulettes, past the little estate of her uncle
Macquart, the latter caught sight of her as he stood upon his
terrace, which was ornamented with a couple of mulberry
trees.</p>

<p>'Where is Mouret?' he cried. 'Why hasn't Mouret come
as well?'</p>

<p>Marthe was obliged to stop for a moment or two to speak
to her uncle, and to explain to him that she was not well,
and could not stay to dine with him. He had expressed his
determination to kill a fowl for the meal.</p>

<p>'Well,' he said at last, 'I'll kill it all the same, and you
shall take it away with you.'</p>

<p>Then he hurried off to kill the fowl at once. When he
came back with it, he laid it on a stone table in front of the
house, and exclaimed with an expression of satisfaction:</p>

<p>'Isn't it a plump, splendid fellow?'</p>

<p>At the moment of Marthe's arrival Macquart had been on
the point of drinking a bottle of wine under the shade of his
mulberry trees, in company with a tall thin young fellow,
dressed entirely in grey. He persuaded the two women to
leave the carriage and sit down beside him for a time, bringing
them chairs, and doing the honours of his house with a snigger
of satisfaction.</p>

<p>'I have a very nice little place here, haven't I? My
mulberries are very fine ones. In the summer I smoke my
pipe out here in the fresh air. In the winter I sit down
yonder with my back to the wall in the sun. Do you see my
vegetables? The fowl-house is at the bottom of the garden.
I have another strip of ground as well, behind the house,
where I grow potatoes and lucern. I am getting old now,
worse luck, and it's quite time that I should enjoy myself a
little.'</p>

<p>He rubbed his hands together and gently wagged his head,
as he cast an affectionate glance over his little estate. Then
some thought seemed to sadden him.</p>

<p>'Have you seen your father lately?' he abruptly asked.
'Rougon isn't very amiable, you know. That cornfield over
yonder to the left is for sale. If he had been willing we
might have bought it. What would it have been for a man
of his means? A paltry three thousand francs is all that is
asked, but he refuses to have anything to do with it. The
last time I went to see him he even made your mother tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
me that he wasn't at home. But, you'll see, it will be all the
worse for them in the end.'</p>

<p>He wagged his head and indulged in his unpleasant laugh,
as he repeated:</p>

<p>'Yes, yes; it will be all the worse for them.'</p>

<p>Then he went to fetch some glasses, for he insisted upon
making the two women taste his wine. It was some light
wine which he had discovered at Saint-Eutrope, and in which
he took great pride. Marthe scarcely wetted her lips, but
Olympe finished the bottle. And afterwards she even accepted
a glass of syrup, saying that the wine was very strong.</p>

<p>'And what have you done with your priest?' Uncle
Macquart suddenly asked his niece.</p>

<p>Marthe looked at him in surprise and displeasure without
replying.</p>

<p>'I heard that he was sponging on you tremendously,'
Macquart loudly continued. 'Those priests are fond of good
living. When I heard about him, I said that it served
Mouret quite right. I warned him. Well, I shall be glad to
help you to turn him out of the house. Mouret has only got
to come and ask me, and I'll give him a helping hand. I've
never been able to endure those fellows. I know one of them,
Abbé Fenil, who has a house on the other side of the road.
He is no better than the rest of them, but he is as malicious
as an ape, and he amuses me. I fancy that he doesn't get on
very well with that priest of yours; isn't that so, eh?'</p>

<p>Marthe had turned very pale.</p>

<p>'Madame here is the sister of his reverence Abbé Faujas,'
she said, turning to Olympe, who was listening with much
curiosity.</p>

<p>'What I said has no reference to madame,' replied Macquart
quite unconcernedly. 'Madame is not offended, I'm sure.
She will take another glass of syrup?'</p>

<p>Olympe accepted another glass of the syrup, but Marthe
rose from her seat and wished to leave. Her uncle, however,
insisted upon taking her over his grounds. At the end of the
garden she stopped to look at a large white building that was
on the slope of the hill, at a few hundred yards from Les
Tulettes. Its inner courts looked like prison-yards, and the
narrow symmetrical windows which streaked its front with
black lines gave it the cheerless aspect of a hospital.</p>

<p>'That is the Lunatic Asylum,' exclaimed Macquart, who
had followed the direction of Marthe's eyes. 'The young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
here is one of the warders. We get on very well together,
and he comes every now and then to have a bottle of wine
with me.'</p>

<p>Then, turning towards the man in grey, who was finishing
his glass beneath the mulberry tree, he called out:</p>

<p>'Here, Alexandre, come and show my niece our poor old
woman's window.'</p>

<p>Alexandre came up to them politely.</p>

<p>'Do you see those three trees?' he said, stretching out his
forefinger, as though he were drawing a plan in the air.
'Well, a little below the one to the left, you can see a fountain
in the corner of a courtyard. Follow the windows on the
ground floor to the right; it is the fifth one.'</p>

<p>Marthe stood there in silence, her lips white and her gaze
fixed, in spite of herself, on the window pointed out to her.
Uncle Macquart was looking at it as well, but with complaisance
manifest in his blinking eyes.</p>

<p>'I see her sometimes of a morning,' he said, 'when the
sun is on the other side. She keeps very well, doesn't she,
Alexandre? I always tell them so when I go to Plassans. I
am very well placed here to keep a watch on her. I couldn't
be anywhere better.'</p>

<p>He again gave a snigger of satisfaction.</p>

<p>'The Rougons, you know, my dear, haven't got any
stronger heads than the Macquarts have, and I often think, as
I sit out here in front of that big house, that the whole lot
will, perhaps, join the mother there some day. Thank
Heaven, I've no fear about myself. My noddle is firmly fixed
on. But I know some of them who are a little shaky. Well,
I shall be here to receive them, and I shall see them from my
den, and recommend them to Alexandre's kind attention,
though they haven't all of them always been particularly
kind to me.'</p>

<p>Then with that hideous smile of his that was like a captive
wolf's, he added:</p>

<p>'It's very lucky for you all that I am here on the spot at
Les Tulettes.'</p>

<p>Marthe could not help trembling. Though she was well
aware of her uncle's taste for savage pleasantries, and the
pleasure he took in torturing the people to whom he presented
his rabbits, she could not help fancying that he was perhaps
speaking the truth, and that the rest of the family would
indeed be quartered eventually in those gloomy cells. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
insisted upon taking her immediate departure in spite of the
pressing entreaties of Macquart, who wanted to open another
bottle of wine.</p>

<p>'Ah! where is the fowl?' he cried, just as she was getting
into the carriage.</p>

<p>He went back for it, and placed it upon her knees.</p>

<p>'It is for Mouret, you understand,' he said, with a malicious
expression; 'for Mouret, and for no one else. When I come
to see you, I shall ask him how he liked it.'</p>

<p>He winked as he glanced at Olympe. Then, just as the
coachman was going to whip his horse forward, he laid hold
of the carriage again, and said:</p>

<p>'Go and see your father and talk to him about the cornfield.
See, it's that field just in front of us. Rougon is
making a mistake. We are too old friends to quarrel about
the matter; besides, as he very well knows, it would be worse
for him if we did. Let him understand that he is making a
mistake.'</p>

<p>The carriage set off, and as Olympe turned round she saw
Macquart grinning under his mulberry trees with Alexandre,
and uncorking that second bottle of which he had spoken.
Marthe gave the coachman strict orders that he was never to
take her to Les Tulettes again. She was beginning to feel a
little tired of these drives into the country, and she took them
less frequently, and at last gave them up altogether, when she
found that she could never prevail upon Abbé Faujas to
accompany her.</p>

<p>Marthe was now undergoing a complete change; she was
becoming quite another woman. She had grown much more
refined, through the life of nervous excitement which she had
been leading. The stolid heaviness and dull lifelessness
which she had acquired from having spent fifteen years behind
a counter at Marseilles seemed to melt away in the
bright flame of her new-born piety. She dressed better than
she had been used to do, and joined in the conversation when
she now went to the Rougons' on Thursdays.</p>

<p>'Madame Mouret is becoming quite a young girl again,'
exclaimed Madame de Condamin in amazement.</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed,' replied Doctor Porquier, nodding his head;
'she is going through life backwards.'</p>

<p>Marthe, who had now grown much slimmer, with rosy
cheeks and magnificent black flashing eyes, burst for some
months into singular beauty. Her face beamed with animation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
extraordinary vitality seemed to flood her being and
thrill her with warmth. Her forgotten and joyless youth
appeared to blaze in her now, at forty years of age. At the
same time she was overwhelmed by a perpetual craving for
prayer and devotion, and no longer obeyed Abbé Faujas's injunctions.
She wore out her knees upon the flag-stones at
Saint-Saturnin's, lived in the midst of canticles and offerings
of praise and worship, and took comfort in the presence of
the gleaming monstrances and the brightly lit chapels, and
priests and altars that glittered with starry sheen through the
dark gloom of the cathedral nave. She had a sort of physical
craving for those glories, a craving which tortured and racked
her. She was compelled by her very suffering&mdash;she would
have died if she had not yielded&mdash;to seek sustenance for her
passion, to come and prostrate herself in confession, to bow in
lowly awe amidst the thrilling peals of the organ, and to faint
with melting joy in the ecstasy of communion. Then all
consciousness of trouble left her, she was no longer tortured,
she bowed herself to the ground in a painless trance, etherealised,
as it were, becoming a pure, unsullied flame of self-consuming
love.</p>

<p>But Faujas's severity increased, he tried to check her by
roughness. He was amazed at this passionate awakening of
Marthe's soul, this ardour for love and death. He frequently
questioned her on the subject of her childhood; he even went
to see Madame Rougon, and remained for a long time in great
perplexity and dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>'Our landlady has been complaining of you,' his mother
said to him. 'Why won't you allow her to go to church
whenever she likes? It is very unkind of you to vex her;
she is very kindly to us.'</p>

<p>'She is killing herself,' replied the priest.</p>

<p>Madame Faujas shrugged her shoulders after her usual
fashion.</p>

<p>'That is her own business. We all have our ways of
finding pleasure. It is better to die of praying than to give
one's self indigestion like that hussy Olympe. Don't be so
severe with Madame Mouret. You will end by making it
impossible for us to live here.'</p>

<p>One day when she was advising him in this way, he
exclaimed in a gloomy voice:</p>

<p>'Mother, this woman will be the obstacle!'</p>

<p>'She!' cried the old peasant woman, 'why, she worships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
you, Ovide! You may do anything you like with her, if you
will only treat her a little more kindly. She would carry you
to the cathedral if it rained, to prevent you wetting your feet,
if you would only let her!'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas himself at last came to understand the
necessity of no longer treating Marthe so harshly. He began
to fear an outburst. So he gradually allowed her greater
liberty, permitted her to seclude herself, to tell her beads at
length, to offer prayers at each of the Stations of the Cross,
and even to come twice a week to his confessional at Saint-Saturnin's.
Marthe, no longer hearing the terrible voice
which had seemed to impute her piety to her as a vice, believed
that God was pouring His grace upon her. Now at
last, she thought, she was entering into all the joys of Paradise.
She was overcome by trances of sweet emotion, inexhaustible
floods of tears, which she shed without being
conscious of their flow, and nervous ecstasies from which she
emerged weak and faint as though all her life-blood had left her
veins. At these times, Rose would take her and lay her upon
her bed, where she would lie for hours with pinched lips and
half-closed eyes like a dead woman.</p>

<p>One afternoon the cook, alarmed by her stillness, was really
afraid that she might be dead. She did not think of knocking
at the door of the room in which Mouret had shut himself,
but she went straight to the second floor and besought Abbé
Faujas to come down to her mistress. When he reached
Marthe's room, Rose hastened to fetch some ether, leaving
the priest alone with the swooning woman. He merely took
her hands within his own. At last Marthe began to move
about and talk incoherently. When she at last recognised
him at her bedside her blood surged to her face.</p>

<p>'Are you better, my dear child?' he asked her. 'You
make me feel very uneasy.'</p>

<p>She felt too much oppressed at first to be able to reply to
him, and burst into tears, as she let her head slip between his
arms.</p>

<p>'I am not ill,' she murmured at last, in so feeble a voice
that it was scarcely more than a breath; 'I am too happy.
Let me cry; I feel delight in my tears. How kind of you to
have come! I had been expecting you and calling you for a
long time.'</p>

<p>Then her voice grew weaker and weaker till it was nothing
more than a mere murmur of ardent prayer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh! who will give me wings to fly towards thee? My
soul languishes without thee, it longs for thee passionately
and sighs for thee, O my God, my only good thing, my consolation,
my sweet joy, my treasure, my happiness, my life, my
God, my all&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Her face broke into a smile as she breathed these passionate
words, and she clasped her hands fancying that she saw
Abbé Faujas's grave face circled by an aureole. The priest,
who had hitherto always succeeded in checking anything of
this sort, felt alarmed for a moment and hastily withdrew his
arms. Then he exclaimed authoritatively:</p>

<p>'Be calm and reasonable; I desire you to be so. God will
refuse your homage if you do not offer it to Him in calm
reason. What is most urgent now is to restore your
strength.'</p>

<p>Rose returned to the room, quite distracted at not having
been able to find any ether. The priest told her to remain
by the bedside, while he said to Marthe in a more gentle
tone:</p>

<p>'Don't distress yourself. God will be touched by your love.
When the proper time comes, He will come down to you and
fill you with everlasting felicity.'</p>

<p>Then he quitted the room, leaving the ailing woman quite
radiant, like one raised from the dead. From that day
forward he was able to mould her like soft wax beneath his
touch. She became extremely useful to him in certain
delicate missions to Madame de Condamin, and she also frequently
visited Madame Rastoil when he expressed a desire
that she should do so. She rendered him absolute obedience,
never seeking the reason of anything he told her to do, but
saying just what he instructed her to say and no more. He
no longer observed any precautions with her, but bluntly
taught her her lessons and made use of her as though she
were a machine. She would have begged in the streets if he
had ordered her to do so. When she became restless and
stretched out her hands to him, with bursting heart and
passion-swollen lips, he crushed her with a single word beneath
the will of Heaven. She never dared to make any reply.
Between her and the priest there was a wall of anger and
scorn. When Abbé Faujas left her after one of the short
struggles which he occasionally had with her, he shrugged
his shoulders with the disdain of a strong wrestler who has
been opposed by a child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>Though Marthe was so pliant in the hands of the priest,
she grew more querulous and sour every day amidst all the
little cares of household life. Rose said that she had never
before known her to be so fractious. It was towards her
husband that she specially manifested increasing bitterness
and dislike. The old leaven of the Rougons' rancour was
reviving in presence of this son of a Macquart, this man whom
she accused of being the torture of her life. When Madame
Faujas or Olympe came downstairs to sit with her in the
dining-room she no longer observed any reticence, but gave
full vent to her feelings against Mouret.</p>

<p>'For twenty years he kept me shut up like a mere clerk,
with a pen behind my ear, between his jars of oil and bags of
almonds! He never allowed me a pleasure or gave me a
present. He has robbed me of my children; and he is quite
capable of taking himself off any day to make people believe
that I have made his life unendurable. It is very fortunate
that you are here and can tell the truth.'</p>

<p>She fell foul of Mouret in this way without any provocation
from him. Everything that he did, his looks, his gestures,
the few words he spoke, all seemed to infuriate her.
She could not even see him without being carried away by
an unreasoning anger. It was at the close of their meals,
when Mouret, without waiting for dessert, folded his napkin
and silently rose from table, that quarrels more especially
occurred.</p>

<p>'You might leave the table at the same time as other
people,' Marthe would bitterly remark; 'it is not very polite
of you to behave in that way.'</p>

<p>'I have finished, and I am going away,' Mouret replied in
his drawling voice.</p>

<p>Marthe began to imagine that her husband's daily retreat
from table was an intentional slight to Abbé Faujas, and
thereupon she lost all control over herself.</p>

<p>'You are a perfect boor, you make me feel quite ashamed!'
she cried. 'I should have a nice time of it with you if I had
not been fortunate enough to make some friends who console
me for your boorish ways! You don't even know how to
behave yourself at table, you prevent me from enjoying a
single meal. Stay where you are, do you hear? If you don't
want to eat any more, you can look at us.'</p>

<p>He finished folding his napkin as calmly as though he had
not heard a word of what his wife had said, and then, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
slow and deliberate steps, he left the room. They could hear
him go upstairs and lock himself in his office. Thereupon
Marthe, choking with anger, burst out:</p>

<p>'Oh, the monster! He is killing me; he is killing me!'</p>

<p>Madame Faujas was obliged to console and soothe her.
Rose ran to the foot of the stairs and called out at the top of
her voice, so that Mouret might hear her through the closed
door:</p>

<p>'You are a monster, sir! Madame is quite right to call
you a monster!'</p>

<p>Some of their quarrels were particularly violent. Marthe,
whose reason was on the verge of giving way, had got it into
her head that her husband wished to beat her. It was a fixed
idea of hers. She asserted that he was only waiting and
watching for an opportunity. He had not dared to do it yet,
she said, because he had never found her alone, and in the
night-time he was afraid lest she should cry out for assistance.
Rose on her side swore that she had seen her master hiding a
thick stick in his office. Madame Faujas and Olympe showed
no hesitation in believing these stories, expressed the greatest
pity for their landlady, and constituted themselves her protectors.
'That brute,' as they now called Mouret, would not
venture, they said, to ill-treat her in their presence; and they
told her to come for them at night if he should show the least
sign of violence. The house was now in a constant state of
alarm.</p>

<p>'He is capable of any wickedness,' exclaimed the cook.</p>

<p>That year Marthe observed all the religious ceremonies of
Passion Week with the greatest fervour. On Good Friday
she knelt in agony in the black-draped church, while the
candles were extinguished, one by one, midst the mournful
swell of voices rising through the gloomy nave. It seemed
to her as though her own breath were dying away with the
light of the candles. When the last one went out, and the
darkness in front of her seemed implacable and repelling, she
fainted away, remaining for an hour bent in an attitude of
prayer without the women around her being aware of her
condition. When she came to herself, the church was deserted.
She imagined that she was being scourged with rods
and that blood was streaming from her limbs; she experienced
too such excruciating pains in her head that she raised her
hands to it, as if to pull out thorns whose points she seemed
to feel piercing her skull. She was in a strange condition at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
dinner that evening. She was still suffering from nervous
shock; when she closed her eyes, she saw the souls of the
expiring candles flitting away through the darkness, and she
mechanically examined her hands for the wounds whence her
blood had streamed. All the Passion bled within her.</p>

<p>Madame Faujas, seeing her so unwell, persuaded her to go
to rest early, accompanied her to her room and put her to
bed. Mouret, who had a key of the bedroom, had already
retired to his office, where he spent his evenings. When
Marthe, covered up to her chin with the blankets, said that
she was quite warm and felt better, Madame Faujas went to
blow out the candle that she might be better able to sleep;
but at this Marthe sprang up in fear and cried out beseechingly:</p>

<p>'No! no! don't put out the light! Put it on the drawers
so that I can see it. I should die if I were left in the dark.'</p>

<p>Then, with staring eyes, trembling as though at the recollection
of some dreadful tragedy, she murmured in tones of
terrified pity: 'Oh, it is horrible! it is horrible!'</p>

<p>She fell back upon the pillow and seemed to drop asleep,
and Madame Faujas then silently left the room. That evening
the whole house was in bed by ten o'clock. As Rose went
upstairs, she noticed that Mouret was still in his office. She
peeped through the key-hole and saw him asleep there with
his head on the table, and a kitchen-candle smoking dismally
by his side.</p>

<p>'Well, I won't wake him,' she said to herself as she continued
her journey upstairs. 'Let him get a stiff neck, if he
likes.'</p>

<p>About midnight, when the whole house was wrapped in
slumber, cries were heard proceeding from the first floor. At
first they were but wails, but they soon grew into loud howls,
like the hoarse, choking calls of one who is being murdered.
Abbé Faujas, awaking with a start, called his mother, who
scarcely gave herself time to slip on a petticoat before she went
to knock at Rose's door.</p>

<p>'Come down immediately!' she said, 'I'm afraid Madame
Mouret is being murdered.'</p>

<p>The screams became louder than ever. The whole house
was soon astir. Olympe with her shoulders simply hidden by
a kerchief, made her appearance with Trouche, who had only
just returned home, slightly intoxicated. Rose hastened downstairs,
followed by the lodgers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>'Open the door, madame, open the door!' she cried excitedly,
hammering with her fist on Madame Mouret's door.</p>

<p>Deep sighs alone answered her; then there was the sound
of a body falling, and a terrible struggle seemed to be taking
place on the floor in the midst of overturned furniture. The
walls shook with repeated heavy blows, and a sound like
a death-rattle passed under the door, so terrible that the
Faujases and the Trouches turned pale as they looked at
each other.</p>

<p>'Her husband is murdering her,' murmured Olympe.</p>

<p>'Yes, you are right; the brute is killing her,' said the
cook. 'I saw him pretending to be asleep when I came up to
bed. But he was planning it all then.'</p>

<p>She once more thundered on the door with both her fists,
repeating:</p>

<p>'Open the door, sir! We shall go for the police if you
don't. Oh, the scoundrel! he will end his days on the scaffold!'</p>

<p>Then the groans and cries began again. Trouche declared
that the blackguard must be bleeding the poor lady like a
fowl.</p>

<p>'We must do something more than knock at the door,'
said Abbé Faujas, coming forward. 'Wait a moment.'</p>

<p>He put one of his broad shoulders to the door and with a
slow persistent effort forced it open. The women then rushed
into the room, where the most extraordinary spectacle met
their eyes.</p>

<p>Marthe, her night-dress torn, lay panting on the floor,
bruised, scratched, and bleeding. Her dishevelled hair was
twined round the leg of a chair, and her hands had so firmly
gripped hold of the chest of drawers, that it was pulled from
its place and now stood in front of the door. Mouret was
standing in a corner, holding the candle and gazing at his
wife with an expression of stupefaction.</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas had to push the chest of drawers on one
side.</p>

<p>'You are a monster!' cried Rose, rushing up to Mouret
and shaking her fist at him. 'To treat a woman like that!
He would have killed her, if we hadn't come in time to
prevent him.'</p>

<p>Madame Faujas and Olympe bent down over Marthe.
'Poor dear!' said the former. 'She had a presentiment
of something this evening. She was quite frightened.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>'Where are you hurt?' asked Olympe. 'There is nothing
broken, is there? Look at her shoulder, it's quite black;
and her knee is dreadfully grazed. Make yourself easy; we
are with you, and we will protect you.'</p>

<p>But Marthe was now simply wailing like a child. While
the two women were examining her, forgetting that there
were men in the room, the Abbé quietly put the furniture in
order. Then Rose helped Madame Faujas and Olympe to
carry Marthe back to bed, and when they had done so and
had knotted up her hair, they lingered for a moment, looking
curiously round the room and waiting for explanations.
Mouret still stood in the same corner holding the candle, as
though petrified by what he had seen.</p>

<p>'I assure you,' he said, 'that I didn't hurt her; I didn't
touch her with the tip of my finger even.'</p>

<p>'You've been waiting for your opportunity this month
past,' cried Rose in a fury; 'we all know that well enough;
we have watched you. The dear lady was quite expecting
your brutality. Don't tell lies about it; they put me quite
beside myself!'</p>

<p>The other women cast threatening glances at him, though
they did not feel at liberty to speak to him in the same way
as Rose had done.</p>

<p>'I assure you,' repeated Mouret in a gentle voice, 'that I
did not strike her. I was just about to get into bed, but the
moment I touched the candle, which was standing on the
drawers, she awoke with a start, stretched out her arms with
a cry, and then began to beat her forehead with her fists and
tear her flesh with her nails.'</p>

<p>The cook shook her head furiously.</p>

<p>'Why didn't you open the door?' she cried; 'we knocked
loud enough.'</p>

<p>'I assure you that I have done nothing,' he reiterated still
more gently than before. 'I could not tell what was the
matter with her. She threw herself upon the floor, bit herself
and leapt about so violently as almost to break the
furniture. I did not dare to go near her; I was quite
overcome. I twice called to you to come in, but she was
screaming so loudly that she must have prevented you from
hearing me. I was in a terrible fright, but I have done
nothing, I assure you.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes! She's been beating herself, hasn't she?' jeered
Rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, addressing herself to Madame Faujas, she added:</p>

<p>'He threw his stick out of the window, no doubt, when he
heard us coming.'</p>

<p>Mouret at last put the candle back upon the chest of
drawers and seated himself on a chair, with his hands upon
his knees. He made no further attempt to defend himself,
but gazed with stupefaction at the women who were shaking
their skinny arms in front of the bed. Trouche had exchanged
a glance with Abbé Faujas. That poor fellow, Mouret,
certainly had no very ferocious appearance as he sat there in
his night-gown, with a yellow handkerchief tied round his bald
head. However, the others all closed round the bed and
looked at Marthe, who, with distorted face, seemed to be
waking from a dream.</p>

<p>'What is the matter, Rose?' she asked. 'What are all
these people doing here? I am quite exhausted. Ask them
to leave me in peace.'</p>

<p>Rose hesitated for a moment.</p>

<p>'Your husband is in the room, madame,' she said at last.
'Aren't you afraid to remain alone with him?'</p>

<p>Marthe looked at her in astonishment.</p>

<p>'No, no; not at all,' she replied. 'Go away; I am very
sleepy.'</p>

<p>Thereupon the five people quitted the room, leaving
Mouret seated on the chair, staring blankly towards the
bed.</p>

<p>'He won't be able to fasten the door again,' the cook exclaimed
as she went back upstairs. 'At the very first sound
I shall fly down and be at him. I shall go to bed with my
things on. Did you hear what stories the dear lady told to
prevent him from appearing such a brute? She would let
herself be murdered rather than accuse him. What a hypocritical
face he has, hasn't he?'</p>

<p>The three women remained for a few moments on the
landing of the second floor, holding their candlesticks the
while. No punishment, said they, would be severe enough
for such a man. Then they separated. The house fell into
its wonted quietness, and the remainder of the night passed
off peacefully. The next morning, when the three women
eagerly referred to the terrible scene, they found Marthe
nervous, shamefaced and confused. She gave them no
answer but cut the conversation short. When she was alone
she sent for a workman to come and mend the door. Madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Faujas and Olympe came to the conclusion that Madame
Mouret's reticence was caused by a desire to avoid scandal.</p>

<p>The next day, Easter Day, Marthe tasted at Saint-Saturnin's
all the sweetness of an awakening of the soul
amidst the triumphant joys of the Resurrection. The gloom
of Good Friday was swept away by the brightness of Easter;
the church was decked in white, and was full of perfume and
light, as though for the celebration of some divine nuptials; the
voices of the choir-boys sounded flute-like, and Marthe, amidst
their songs of joyful praise, felt transported by even more
thrilling, overwhelming sensations than during the celebration
of the crucifixion. She returned home with glistening eyes
and hot dry tongue, and sat up late, talking with a gaiety
that was unusual in her. Mouret was already in bed when
she at last went upstairs. About midnight, terrible cries
again echoed through the house.</p>

<p>The scene that had taken place two days previously was
repeated: only on this occasion, at the first knock, Mouret
came in his night-gown and with distracted face to open the
door. Marthe, still dressed, was lying on her stomach,
sobbing violently and beating her head against the foot of the
bed. The bodice of her dress looked as though it had been
torn open, and there were two big scratches on her throat.</p>

<p>'He has tried to strangle her this time!' exclaimed Rose.</p>

<p>The women undressed her. Mouret, after opening the
door, had got back into bed, trembling all over and as
pale as a sheet. He made no attempt to defend himself; he
did not even appear to hear the indignant remarks that were
made about him, but simply covered himself up and lay close
to the wall. Similar scenes now took place at irregular
intervals. The house lived in a state of fear lest a crime
should be committed; and, at the slightest noise, the
occupants of the second floor were astir. Marthe, however,
still avoided all allusions to the matter, and absolutely forbade
Rose to prepare a folding bed for Mouret in his office.
When the morning came, it seemed to take away from her
the very recollection of the scene of the night.</p>

<p>However, it was gradually reported about the neighbourhood
that strange things happened at the Mourets'. It
was said that the husband belaboured his wife every night
with a bludgeon. Rose had made Madame Faujas and
Olympe swear that they would say nothing on the subject,
as her mistress seemingly wished to keep silence upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
it; but she herself, by her expressions of pity and her
allusions and her reservations, materially contributed to set
afloat amongst the tradesmen the stories that became current.
The butcher, who was a great jester, asserted that Mouret
had thrashed his wife on account of the priest, but the greengrocer's
wife defended 'the poor lady,' who was, she declared,
an innocent lamb quite incapable of doing any
wrong. The baker's spouse, on the other hand, considered
that Mouret was one of those men who ill-treat their wives
for mere pleasure and amusement. In the market-place
people raised their eyes to heaven when they spoke of the
matter, and referred to Marthe in the same terms of caressing
endearment that they would have used in speaking of a sick
child. Whenever Olympe went to buy a pound of cherries or
a basket of strawberries, the conversation inevitably turned
upon the Mourets, and for a quarter of an hour there was a
stream of sympathetic remarks.</p>

<p>'Well, and how are things getting on in your house?'</p>

<p>'Oh, don't speak of it! She is weeping her life away. It
is most pitiable. One could almost wish to see her die.'</p>

<p>'She came to buy some anchovies the other day, and I
noticed that one of her cheeks was scratched.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes! he nearly kills her! If you could only see her
body as I have seen it! It is nothing but one big sore.
When she is down on the ground he kicks her with his heels.
I am in constant fear of finding in the morning that he has
split her head open during the night.'</p>

<p>'It must be very unpleasant for you, living in such a house.
I should go somewhere else, if I were in your place. It would
make me quite ill to be mixed up with such horrors every
night.'</p>

<p>'But what would become of the poor woman? She is so
refined and gentle! We stay on for her sake&mdash;five sous, isn't
it, this pound of cherries?'</p>

<p>'Yes; five sous. Well, it's very good of you; you show a
kind heart.'</p>

<p>This story of a husband who waited till midnight to fall
upon his wife with a bludgeon excited the greatest interest
amongst the gossips of the market-place. There were further
terrible details every day. One pious woman asserted that
Mouret was possessed by an evil spirit, and that he seized
his wife by the neck with his teeth with such violence that
Abbé Faujas was obliged to make the sign of the cross three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
times in the air with his left thumb before the monster could
be made to let go his hold. Then, she added, Mouret fell
to the ground like a great lump, and a huge black rat leapt
out of his mouth and vanished, though not the slightest hole
could be discovered in the flooring. The tripe-seller at the
corner of the Rue Taravelle terrified the neighbourhood by
promulgating the theory that 'the scoundrel had perhaps
been bitten by a mad dog.'</p>

<p>The story, however, was not credited among the higher
classes of the inhabitants of Plassans. When it was mooted
about the Cours Sauvaire it afforded the retired traders much
amusement, as they sat on the benches there, basking in the
warm May sun.</p>

<p>'Mouret is quite incapable of beating his wife,' said the
retired almond-dealers; 'he looks as though he had had a
whipping himself, and he no longer even comes out for a turn
on the promenade. His wife must be keeping him on dry
bread.'</p>

<p>'One can never tell,' said a retired captain. 'I knew an
officer in my regiment whose wife used to box his ears for a
mere yes or no. That went on for ten years. Then one day
she took it into her head to kick him; but that made him
quite furious and he nearly strangled her. Perhaps Mouret
has the same dislike to being kicked as my friend had.'</p>

<p>'He probably has a yet greater dislike to priests,' said
another of the company with a sneer.</p>

<p>For some time Madame Rougon appeared quite unconscious
of the scandal which was occupying the attention of the
town. She preserved a smiling face and ignored the allusions
which were made before her. One day, however, after a long
visit from Monsieur Delangre, she arrived at her daughter's
house looking greatly distressed, her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>'Ah, my dear!' she cried, clasping Marthe in her arms,
'what is this that I have just heard? Can your husband
really have so far forgotten himself so as to have raised his
hand against you? It is all a pack of falsehoods, isn't it?
I have given it the strongest denial. I know Mouret. He
has been badly brought up, but he is not a wicked man.'</p>

<p>Marthe blushed. She was overcome by that embarrassment
and shame which she experienced every time this subject
was alluded to in her presence.</p>

<p>'Ah! madame will never complain!' cried Rose with her
customary boldness. 'I should have come and informed you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
a long time ago if I had not been afraid of madame being
angry with me.'</p>

<p>The old lady let her hands fall with an expression of
extreme grief and surprise.</p>

<p>'It is really true, then,' she exclaimed, 'that he beats
you! Oh, the wretch! the wretch!'</p>

<p>Thereupon she began to weep.</p>

<p>'For me to have lived to my age to see such things! A
man whom we have overwhelmed with kindnesses ever since
his father's death, when he was only a little clerk with us!
It was Rougon who desired your marriage. I told him more
than once that Mouret looked like a scoundrel. He has never
treated us well; and he only came to live at Plassans for the
sake of setting us at defiance with the few sous he has got
together. Thank heaven, we stand in no need of him; we
are richer than he is, and it is that which annoys him. He
is very mean-spirited, and so jealous that he has always
refused to set foot in my drawing-room. He knows he would
burst with envy there. But I won't leave you in the power
of such a monster, my dear. There are laws, happily.'</p>

<p>'Oh don't be uneasy! There has been much exaggeration,
I assure you,' said Marthe, who was growing more and more
ill at ease.</p>

<p>'You see that she is trying to defend him!' cried the
cook.</p>

<p>At this moment, Abbé Faujas and Trouche, who had been
conferring together at the bottom of the garden, came up,
attracted by the sound of the conversation.</p>

<p>'I am a most unhappy mother, your reverence,' said
Madame Rougon piteously. 'I have only one daughter near
me now, and I hear she is weeping her eyes out from ill-treatment.
But you live in the same house, and I beg you to
protect and console her.'</p>

<p>The Abbé fixed his eyes upon the old woman, as though
he were trying to guess the real meaning of this sudden
manifestation of distress.</p>

<p>'I have just seen some one whom I would rather not
name,' she continued, returning the Abbé's glance. 'This
person has quite alarmed me. God knows that I don't want
to do anything to injure my son-in-law! But it is my duty&mdash;is
it not?&mdash;to defend my daughter's interests. Well, my
son-in-law is a wretch; he ill-treats his wife, he scandalises
the whole town, and mixes himself up in all sorts of dirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
affairs. You will see that he will also compromise himself in
political matters when the elections come on. The last time
it was he who put himself at the head of the riff-raff of the
suburbs. It will kill me, your reverence!'</p>

<p>'Monsieur Mouret would not allow anybody to make
remarks to him about his conduct,' the Abbé at last ventured
to say.</p>

<p>'But I can't abandon my daughter to such a man!' cried
Madame Rougon. 'I will not allow it that we should be dishonoured.
Justice is not made for dogs.'</p>

<p>Trouche, who was swaying himself about, took advantage
of a momentary pause to exclaim:</p>

<p>'Monsieur Mouret is mad!'</p>

<p>The words seemed to fall with all the force of a blow from
a club, and everybody looked at the speaker.</p>

<p>'I mean that he has a weak head,' continued Trouche.
'You've only got to look at his eyes. I may tell you that I
don't feel particularly easy myself. There was a man at
Besançon who adored his daughter, but he murdered her one
night without knowing what he was doing.'</p>

<p>'The master has been cracked for a long time past,' said
Rose.</p>

<p>'But this is frightful!' cried Madame Rougon. 'Really,
I fear you may be right. The last time I saw him he had a
most extraordinary expression on his face. He never had
very sharp wits. Ah! my poor dear, promise to confide
everything to me. I shall not be able to sleep quietly after
this. Listen to me now; at the first sign of any extravagant
conduct on your husband's part, don't hesitate, don't run any
further risk&mdash;madmen must be placed in confinement.'</p>

<p>After this speech, she went off. When Trouche was again
alone with Abbé Faujas, he gave one of those unpleasant
grins that exposed his black teeth to view.</p>

<p>'Our landlady will owe me a big taper,' he said. 'She
will be able to kick about at nights as much as she likes.'</p>

<p>The priest, with his face quite ashy and his eyes turned
to the ground, made no reply. Then he shrugged his
shoulders and went off to read his breviary under the arbour
at the bottom of the garden.</p>

<h3><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII">XVIII</a></h3>


<p>On Sundays Mouret, like many of the other retired traders of
Plassans, used to take a stroll about the town. It was on
Sundays only that he now emerged from that lonely seclusion
in which he buried himself, overcome by a sort of shame.
And his Sunday outing was gone through quite mechanically.
In the morning he shaved himself, put on a clean
shirt, and brushed his coat and hat; then, after breakfast,
without quite knowing how, he found himself in the street,
walking along slowly, with his hands behind his back and
looking very sedate and neat.</p>

<p>As he was leaving his house one Sunday, he saw Rose
talking with much animation to Monsieur Rastoil's cook on
the pathway of the Rue Balande. The two servants became
silent when they caught sight of him. They looked at him
with such a peculiar expression that he felt behind him to
ascertain whether his handkerchief was hanging out of his
pocket. When he reached the Place of the Sub-Prefecture
he turned his head, looked back, and saw them still standing
in the same place. Rose was imitating the reeling of a
drunken man, while the president's cook was laughing
loudly.</p>

<p>'I am walking too quickly and they are making fun of me,'
thought Mouret.</p>

<p>He thereupon slackened his pace. As he passed through
the Rue de la Banne towards the market, the shopkeepers
ran to their doors and watched him curiously. He gave a
little nod to the butcher, who looked confused and did not
return the salutation. The baker's wife, to whom he raised
his hat, seemed quite alarmed and hastily stepped backwards.
The greengrocer, the pastrycook and the grocer pointed him
out to each other from opposite sides of the street. As he
went along there was ever excitement behind him, people
clustered together in groups, and a great deal of talking,
mingled with laughs and grins, ensued.</p>

<p>'Did you notice how quickly he was walking?'</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed, when he wanted to stride across the gutter he
almost jumped.'</p>

<p>'It is said that they are all like that.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>'I felt quite frightened. Why is he allowed to come out?
It oughtn't to be permitted.'</p>

<p>Mouret was beginning to feel timid, and dared not venture
to look round again. He experienced a vague uneasiness,
though he could not feel quite sure that it was about himself
that the people were all talking. He quickened his steps and
began to swing his arms about. He regretted that he had put
on his old overcoat, a hazel-coloured one and no longer of a
fashionable cut. When he reached the market-place, he
hesitated for a moment, and then boldly strode into the midst
of the greengrocers' stalls. The mere sight of him caused
quite a commotion there.</p>

<p>All the housewives of Plassans formed in a line about his
path, the market-women stood up by their stalls, with their
hands on their hips, and stared hard at him. People even
pushed one another to get a sight of him, and some of the
women mounted on to the benches in the corn-market.
Mouret still further quickened his steps and tried to disengage
himself from the crowd, not as yet able to believe that it was
he who was causing all this excitement.</p>

<p>'Well, anyone would think that his arms were windmill
sails,' said a peasant-woman who was selling fruit.</p>

<p>'He flies on like a shot; he nearly upset my stall,' exclaimed
another woman, a greengrocer.</p>

<p>'Stop him! stop him!' the millers cried facetiously.
Then Mouret, overcome by curiosity, halted and rose on tip-toes
to see what was the matter. He imagined that someone
had just been detected thieving. But a loud burst of laughter
broke out from the crowd, and there were shouts and hisses,
all sorts of calls and cries.</p>

<p>'There's no harm in him; don't hurt him.'</p>

<p>'Ah! I'm not so sure of that. I shouldn't like to trust
myself too near him. He gets up in the night and strangles
people.'</p>

<p>'He certainly looks a bad one.'</p>

<p>'Has it come upon him suddenly?'</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed, all at once. And he used to be so kind and
gentle! I'm going away; all this distresses me. Here are
the three sous for the turnips.'</p>

<p>Mouret had just recognised Olympe in the midst of a group
of women, and he went towards her. She had been buying
some magnificent peaches, which she carried in a very fashionable-looking
handbag. And she was evidently relating some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
very moving story, for all the gossips around her were breaking
out into exclamations and clasping their hands with
expressions of pity.</p>

<p>'Then,' said she, 'he caught her by the hair, and he would
have cut her throat with a razor which was lying on the chest
of drawers if we hadn't arrived just in time to prevent the
murder. But don't say anything to her about it; it would
only bring her more trouble.'</p>

<p>'What trouble?' asked Mouret in amazement. The
listeners hurried away, and Olympe assumed an expression
of careful watchfulness as, in her turn, she warily slipped off,
saying:</p>

<p>'Don't excite yourself, Monsieur Mouret. You had better
go back home.'</p>

<p>Mouret took refuge in a little lane that led to the Cours
Sauvaire. Thereupon the shouts increased in violence, and
for a few moments he was pursued by the angry uproar of
the market-folk.</p>

<p>'What is the matter with them to-day?' he wondered.
'Could it be me that they were jeering at? But I never heard
my name mentioned. Something out of the common must
have happened.'</p>

<p>He then took off his hat and examined it, imagining that
perhaps some street lad had thrown a handful of mud at it.
It was all right, however, and there was nothing fastened on
to his coat-tails. This examination soothed him a little, and
he resumed his sedate walk through the silent lane, and quietly
turned on to the Cours Sauvaire.</p>

<p>The usual groups of friends were sitting on the benches
there.</p>

<p>'Hallo! here's Mouret!' cried the retired captain, with an
expression of great astonishment.</p>

<p>The liveliest curiosity became manifest on the sleepy faces
of the others. They stretched out their necks without
rising from their seats, while Mouret stood in front of them.
They examined him minutely from head to foot.</p>

<p>'Ah! you are taking a little stroll?' said the captain, who
seemed the boldest.</p>

<p>'Yes, just a short stroll,' replied Mouret, in a listless
fashion. 'It's a very fine day.'</p>

<p>The company exchanged meaning smiles. They were
feeling chilly and the sky had just become overcast.</p>

<p>'Very fine,' said a retired tanner; 'you are easily pleased.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
It is true, however, that you are already wearing winter
clothes. What a funny overcoat that is of yours!'</p>

<p>The smiles now grew into grins and titters. A sudden
idea seemed to strike Mouret.</p>

<p>'Just look and tell me,' said he, suddenly turning round,
'have I got a sun on my back?'</p>

<p>The retired almond-dealers could no longer keep serious,
but burst into loud laughter. The captain, who was the jester
of the company, winked.</p>

<p>'A sun?' he asked, 'where? I can only see a moon.'</p>

<p>The others shook with laughter. They thought the captain
excessively witty.</p>

<p>'A moon?' said Mouret; 'be kind enough to remove it.
It has caused me much inconvenience.'</p>

<p>The captain gave him three or four taps on the back, and
then exclaimed:</p>

<p>'There, you are rid of it now. But it must, indeed, be
extremely inconvenient to have a moon on one's back. You
are not looking very well.'</p>

<p>'I am not very well,' Mouret replied in his listless
indifferent way.</p>

<p>Then, imagining that he heard a titter, he added:</p>

<p>'But I am very well taken care of at home. My wife is
very kind and attentive, and quite spoils me. But I need
rest, and that is the reason why I don't come out now as I
used to do. Directly I am better, I shall look after business
again.'</p>

<p>'But they say it is your wife who is not very well,' interrupted
the retired tanner bluntly.</p>

<p>'My wife! There is nothing the matter with her! It is
a pack of falsehoods! There is nothing the matter with her&mdash;nothing
at all. People say things against us because&mdash;because
we keep quietly at home. Ill, indeed! my wife! She
is very strong, and never even has so much the matter with
her as&mdash;as a headache.'</p>

<p>He went on speaking in short sentences, stammering and
hesitating in the uneasy way of a man who is telling falsehoods;
full too of the embarrassment of a whilom gossip who
has become tongue-tied. The retired traders shook their
heads with pitying looks, and the captain tapped his forehead
with his finger. A former hatter of the suburbs who had
scrutinised Mouret from his cravat to the bottom button of
his overcoat, was now absorbed in the examination of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
boots. The lace of the one on the left foot had come undone,
and this seemed to the hatter a most extraordinary circumstance.
He nudged his neighbours' elbows, and winked as he
called their attention to the loosened lace. Soon the whole
bench had eyes for nothing else but the lace. It was the last
proof. The men shrugged their shoulders in a way that
seemed to imply that they had lost their last spark of hope.</p>

<p>'Mouret,' said the captain, in a paternal fashion, 'fasten
up your boot-lace.'</p>

<p>Mouret glanced at his feet, but did not seem to understand;
and he went on talking. Then, as no one replied, he
became silent, and after standing there for a moment or two
longer he quietly continued his walk.</p>

<p>'He will fall, I'm sure,' exclaimed the master-tanner, who
had risen from his seat that he might keep Mouret longer in
view.</p>

<p>When Mouret got to the end of the Cours Sauvaire, and
passed in front of the Young Men's Club, he was again greeted
with the low laughs which had followed him since he had set
foot out of doors. He could distinctly see Séverin Rastoil,
who was standing at the door of the club, pointing him out
to a group of young men. Clearly, he thought, it was himself
who was thus providing sport for the town. He bent his
head and was seized with a kind of fear, which he could not
explain to himself, as he hastily stepped past the houses.
Just as he was about to turn into the Rue Canquoin, he heard
a noise behind him, and, turning his head, he saw three lads
following him; two of them were big, impudent-looking boys,
while the third was a very little one, with a serious face. The
latter was holding in his hand a dirty orange which he had
picked out of the gutter. Mouret made his way along the
Rue Canquoin, and then, crossing the Place des Récollets, he
reached the Rue de la Banne. The lads were still following
him.</p>

<p>'Do you want your ears pulled?' he called out, suddenly
stepping up to them.</p>

<p>They dashed on one side, shouting and laughing, and made
their escape on their hands and knees. Mouret turned very
red, realising that he was an object of ridicule. He felt a
perfect fear of crossing the Place of the Sub-Prefecture, and
passing in front of the Rougons' windows with a following of
street-arabs, whom he could hear, increasing in numbers and
boldness, behind him. As he went on, he was obliged to step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
out of his way to avoid his mother-in-law, who was returning
from vespers with Madame de Condamin.</p>

<p>'Wolf! wolf!' cried the lads.</p>

<p>Mouret, with perspiration breaking out on his brow, and
his feet stumbling against the flag-stones, overheard old
Madame Rougon say to the wife of the conservator of rivers
and forests:</p>

<p>'See! there he is, the scoundrel! It is disgraceful; we
can't tolerate it much longer.'</p>

<p>Thereupon Mouret could no longer restrain himself from
setting off at a run. With swinging arms and a look of
distraction upon his face, he rushed into the Rue Balande
while some ten or a dozen street-arabs dashed after him. It
seemed to him as though all the shopkeepers of the Rue de
la Banne, the market-women, the promenaders of the Cours,
the young men from the club, the Rougons, the Condamins&mdash;all
the people of Plassans, in fact&mdash;were surging onwards
behind his back, breaking out into laughs and jeers, as he
sped up the hilly street. The lads stamped and slid over the
pavement, making indeed as much noise in that usually quiet
neighbourhood as a pack of hounds might have made.</p>

<p>'Catch him!' they screamed.</p>

<p>'Hie! What a scarecrow he looks in that overcoat of
his!'</p>

<p>'Some of you go round by the Rue Taravelle, and then
you'll nab him!'</p>

<p>'Cut along! cut along as hard as you can go!'</p>

<p>Mouret, now quite frantic, made a desperate rush towards
his door, but his foot slipped and he tumbled upon the foot-pavement,
where he lay for a few moments, utterly overcome.
The lads, afraid lest he should kick out at them, formed a
circle around and vented screams of triumph, while the
smallest of them, gravely stepping forward, threw the rotten
orange at Mouret. It flattened itself against his left eye. He
rose up with difficulty, and went in to his house without
attempting to wipe himself. Rose was forced to come out
with a broom and drive the young ragamuffins away.</p>

<p>From that Sunday forward all Plassans was convinced
that Mouret was a lunatic who ought to be placed under
restraint. The most surprising statements were made in
support of this belief. It was said, for instance, that he shut
himself up for days together in a perfectly empty room which
had not been touched with a broom for a whole year; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
those who circulated this story vouched for its truth, as they
had it, they said, from Mouret's own cook. The accounts
differed as to what he did in that empty room. The cook
said that he pretended to be dead, a statement which thrilled
the whole neighbourhood with horror. The market-people
firmly believed that he kept a coffin concealed in the room,
laid himself at full length in it, with his eyes open and his
hands upon his breast, and remained like that from morning
till night.</p>

<p>'The attack had been threatening him for a long time
past,' Olympe remarked in every shop she entered. 'It was
brooding in him; he had for a long time been very melancholy
and low-spirited, hiding in out-of-the-way corners, just
like an animal, you know, that feels ill. The very first day
I set foot in the house I said to my husband, "The landlord
seems to be in a bad way." His eyes were quite yellow and he
had such a queer look about him. Afterwards he went on in
the strangest way; he had all sorts of extraordinary whims
and crotchets. He used to count every lump of sugar, and
lock everything up, even the bread. He was so dreadfully
miserly that his poor wife hadn't even a pair of boots to put
on. Ah! poor thing, she has a dreadful time of it, and I pity
her from the bottom of my heart. Imagine the life she leads
with a madman who can't even behave decently at table!
He throws his napkin away in the middle of dinner, and
stalks off, looking stupefied, after having made a horrible mess
in his plate. And such a temper he has, too! He used to
make the most terrible scenes just because the mustard pot
wasn't in its right place. But now he doesn't speak at all,
though he glares like a wild beast, and springs at people's
throats without uttering a word. Ah! I could tell you some
strange stories, if I liked.'</p>

<p>When she had thus excited her listeners' curiosity, and
they began to press her with questions, she added:</p>

<p>'No, no; it is no business of mine. Madame Mouret is a
perfect saint, and bears her suffering like a true Christian.
She has her own ideas on the matter, and one must respect
them. But, would you believe it, he tried to cut her throat
with a razor!'</p>

<p>The story she told was always the same, but it never failed
to produce a great effect. Fists were clenched, and women
talked of strangling Mouret. If any incredulous person shook
his head, he was put to confusion by a summons to explain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the dreadful scenes which took place every night. Only a
madman, people said, was capable of flying in that way at
his wife's throat the moment she went to bed. There was a
spice of mystery in the affair which helped materially to
spread the story about the town. For nearly a month the
rumours went on gaining strength. Yet, in spite of Olympe's
tragical gossipings, peace had been restored at the Mourets'
and the nights now passed in quietness. Marthe exhibited
much nervous impatience when her friends, without openly
speaking on the subject, advised her to be very careful.</p>

<p>'You will only go your own way, I suppose,' said Rose.
'Well, you'll see, he will begin again, and we shall find you
murdered one of these fine mornings.'</p>

<p>Madame Rougon now ostentatiously called at the house
every other day. She entered it with an air of extreme
uneasiness, and, as soon as the door was opened, she asked
Rose:</p>

<p>'Well! has anything happened to-day?'</p>

<p>Then, as soon as she caught sight of her daughter, she
kissed her, and threw her arms round her with a great show
of affection, as though she had been afraid that she might
not find her alive. She passed the most dreadful nights, she
said; she trembled at every ring of the bell, imagining that it
was the signal of the tidings of some dreadful calamity; and
she no longer had any pleasure in living. When Marthe told
her that she was in no danger whatever she looked at her
with an expression of admiration, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>'You are a perfect angel! If I were not here to look after
you, you would allow yourself to be murdered without raising
even a sigh. But make yourself easy; I am watching over
you, and am taking all precautions. The first time your
husband raises his little finger against you, he will hear from
me.'</p>

<p>She did not explain herself any further. The truth of the
matter was that she had visited every official in Plassans, and
had in this way confidentially related her daughter's troubles
to the mayor, the sub-prefect, and the presiding judge of the
tribunal, making them promise to observe absolute secrecy
about the matter.</p>

<p>'It is a mother in despair who tells you this,' she said with
tears in her eyes. 'I am giving the honour and reputation of
my poor child into your keeping. My husband would take
to his bed if there were to be a public scandal, but I can't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
wait till there is some fatal catastrophe. Advise me, and tell
me what I ought to do.'</p>

<p>The officials showed her the greatest sympathy and kindness.
They did their best to reassure her, they promised to
keep a careful watch over Madame Mouret without in any
way letting it be known, and to take some active step at the
slightest sign of danger. In her interviews with Monsieur
Péqueur des Saulaies and Monsieur Rastoil, she drew their
especial attention to the fact that, as they were her son-in-law's
immediate neighbours, they would be able to interfere
at once in the event of anything going wrong.</p>

<p>This story of a lunatic in his senses, who awaited the
stroke of midnight to become mad, imparted much interest to
the meetings of the guests in Mouret's garden. They showed
great alacrity in going to greet Abbé Faujas. The priest
came downstairs at four o'clock, and did the honours of the
arbour with much urbanity, but in talking he persisted in keeping
in the background, merely nodding in answer to what was
said to him. For the first few days, only indirect allusions
were made to the drama which was being acted in the house,
but one Tuesday Monsieur Maffre, who was gazing at it with
an uneasy expression, fixing his eyes upon one of the windows
of the first floor, ventured to ask:</p>

<p>'That is the room, isn't it?'</p>

<p>Then, in low tones, the two parties began to discuss the
strange story which was exciting the neighbourhood. The
priest made some vague remarks: it was very sad, and much
to be regretted, said he, and then he pitied everybody, without
venturing to say anything more explicit.</p>

<p>'But you, Doctor,' asked Madame de Condamin of Doctor
Porquier, 'you who are the family doctor, what do you think
about it all?'</p>

<p>Doctor Porquier shook his head for some time before
making any reply. He at first affected a discreet reserve.</p>

<p>'It is a very delicate matter,' he muttered. 'Madame
Mouret is not robust, and as for Monsieur Mouret&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I have seen Madame Rougon,' said the sub-prefect.
'She is very uneasy.'</p>

<p>'Her son-in-law has always been obnoxious to her,'
Monsieur de Condamin exclaimed bluntly. 'I met Mouret
myself at the club the other day, and he gave me a beating at
piquet. He seemed to me to be as sensible as ever. The
good man was never a Solomon, you know.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>'I have not said that he is mad, in the common interpretation
of the word,' said the doctor, thinking that he was
being attacked: 'but neither will I say that I think it prudent
to allow him to remain at large.'</p>

<p>This statement caused considerable emotion, and Monsieur
Rastoil instinctively glanced at the wall which separated the
two gardens. Every face was turned towards the doctor.</p>

<p>'I once knew,' he continued, 'a charming lady, who kept
up a large establishment, giving dinner-parties, receiving the
most distinguished members of society, and showing much
sense and wit in her conversation. Well, when that lady
retired to her bedroom, she locked herself in, and spent a part
of the night in crawling round the room on her hands and
knees, barking like a dog. The people in the house long
imagined that she really had a dog in the room with her.
This lady was an example of what we doctors call lucid
madness.'</p>

<p>Abbé Surin's face was wreathed with twinkling smiles as
he glanced at Monsieur Rastoil's daughters, who appeared
much amused by this story of a fashionable lady turning
herself into a dog. Doctor Porquier blew his nose very
gravely.</p>

<p>'I could give you a score of other similar instances,' he
continued, 'of people who appeared to be in full possession of
their senses, and who yet committed the most extravagant
actions as soon as they found themselves alone.'</p>

<p>'For my part,' said Abbé Bourrette, 'I once had a very
strange penitent. She had a mania for killing flies, and could
never see one without feeling an irresistible desire to capture
it. She used to keep them at home strung upon knitting
needles. When she came to confess, she would weep bitterly
and accuse herself of the death of the poor creatures, and
believe that she was damned. But I could never correct her
of the habit.'</p>

<p>This story was very well received, and even Monsieur
Péqueur des Saulaies and Monsieur Rastoil themselves
condescended to smile.</p>

<p>'There is no great harm done,' said the doctor, 'so long as
one confines one's self to killing flies. But the conduct of all
lucid madmen is not so innocent as that. Some of them
torture their families by some concealed vice, which has
reached the degree of a mania; there are other wretched ones
who drink and give themselves up to secret debauchery, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
who steal because they can't help stealing, or who are mad
with pride or jealousy or ambition. They are able to control
themselves in public, to carry out the most complicated
schemes and projects, to converse rationally and without
giving any one any reason to suspect their mental weakness,
but as soon as they get back to their own private life, and are
alone with their victims, they surrender themselves to their
delirious ideas and become brutal savages. If they don't
murder straight out, they do it gradually.'</p>

<p>'Well, now, what about Monsieur Mouret?' asked Madame
de Condamin.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Mouret has always been a teasing, restless,
despotic sort of man. His cerebral derangement has increased
with his years. I should not hesitate now to class him
amongst dangerous madmen. I had a patient who used to
shut herself up, just as he does, in an unoccupied room, and
spend the whole day in contriving the most abominable
actions.'</p>

<p>'But, doctor, if that is your opinion, you ought to proffer
your advice,' exclaimed Monsieur Rastoil; 'you ought to warn
those who are concerned.'</p>

<p>Doctor Porquier seemed slightly embarrassed.</p>

<p>'Well, we will see about it,' he said, smiling again with
his fashionable doctor's smile. 'If it should be necessary
and matters should become serious, I will do my duty.'</p>

<p>'Pooh!' cried Monsieur de Condamin satirically; 'the
greatest lunatics are not those who have the reputation of
being so. No brain is sound for a mad-doctor. The doctor
here has just been reciting to us a page out of a book on
lucid madness, which I have read, and which is as interesting
as a novel.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas had been listening with curiosity, though
he had taken no part in the conversation. Then, as soon as
there was a pause, he remarked that their talk about mad
people had a depressing effect upon the ladies, and suggested
that the subject should be changed. Everybody's curiosity
was fully awakened, however, and the two sets of guests
began to keep a sharp watch upon Mouret's behaviour. The
latter now came out into the garden for an hour a day, while
the Faujases remained at table with his wife. Directly he
appeared there, he came under the active surveillance of the
Rastoils and the frequenters of the Sub-Prefecture. He could
not stand for a moment in front of a bed of vegetables or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
examine a plant, or even make a gesture of any sort, without
exciting in the gardens on his right and left the most unfavourable
comments. Everyone was turning against him.
Monsieur de Condamin was the only person who still defended
him. One day the fair Octavie said to him as they were at
luncheon:</p>

<p>'What difference can it make to you whether Mouret is
mad or not?'</p>

<p>'To me, my dear? Absolutely none,' he said in astonishment.</p>

<p>'Very well, then, allow that he is mad, since everyone says
he is. I don't know why you always persist in holding a
contrary opinion to your wife's. It won't prove to your
advantage, my dear. Have the intelligence, at Plassans, not
to be too intelligent.'</p>

<p>Monsieur de Condamin smiled.</p>

<p>'You are right, my dear, as you always are,' he said
gallantly; 'you know that I have put my fortune in your
hands&mdash;don't wait dinner for me. I am going to ride to
Saint-Eutrope to have a look at some timber they are felling.'</p>

<p>Then he left the room, biting the end off a cigar.</p>

<p>Madame de Condamin was well aware that he had a flame
for a young girl in the neighbourhood of Saint-Eutrope;
but she was very tolerant and had even saved him twice from
the consequences of scandalous intrigues. On his side, he
felt very easy about his wife; he knew that she was much
too prudent to give cause for scandal at Plassans.</p>

<p>'You would never guess how Mouret spends his time in
that room where he shuts himself up!' the conservator of
rivers and forests said the next morning when he called at
the Sub-Prefecture. 'He is counting all the s's in the Bible.
He is afraid of making any mistake about the matter, and
he has already recommenced counting them for the third
time. Ah! you were quite right; he is cracked from top to
bottom!'</p>

<p>From this time forward Monsieur de Condamin was very
hard upon Mouret. He even exaggerated matters and used
all his skill to invent absurd stories to scare the Rastoils;
but it was Monsieur Maffre whom he made his special victim.
He told him one day that he had seen Mouret standing at one
of the windows overlooking the street in a state of complete
nudity, having only a woman's cap on his head and bowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
to the empty air. Another day he asserted with amazing
assurance that he had seen Mouret dancing like a savage in a
little wood three leagues away; and when the magistrate
seemed to doubt this story, he appeared to be vexed and
declared that Mouret might very easily have got down out of
his house by the water-spout without being noticed. The
frequenters of the Sub-Prefecture smiled, but the next
morning the Rastoils' cook spread these extraordinary stories
about the town, where the legend of the man who beat his
wife was assuming extraordinary proportions.</p>

<p>One afternoon Aurélie, the elder of Monsieur Rastoil's two
daughters, related with a blushing face how on the previous
night, having gone to look out of her window about midnight,
she had seen their neighbour promenading about his garden,
carrying a big altar candle. Monsieur de Condamin thought
the girl was making fun of him, but she gave the most minute
details.</p>

<p>'He held the candle in his left hand; and he knelt down
on the ground and dragged himself along on his knees,
sobbing as he did so.'</p>

<p>'Can it be possible that he has committed a murder and
has buried the body of his victim in his garden?' exclaimed
Monsieur Maffre, who had turned quite pale.</p>

<p>Then the two sets of guests agreed to watch some evening
till midnight if necessary, to clear the matter up. The
following night, indeed, they kept on the alert, in both gardens,
but Mouret did not appear. Three nights were wasted in the
same way. The Sub-Prefecture party was going to abandon
the watch, and Madame de Condamin declared that she could
not stay any longer under the chestnut trees, where it was so
dreadfully dark, when all at once a light was seen flickering
through the inky blackness of the ground floor of Mouret's
house. When Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies' attention was
drawn to this, he slipped into the Impasse des Chevillottes to
invite the Rastoils to come on to his terrace, which overlooked
the neighbouring garden. The presiding judge, who was on
the watch with his daughters behind the cascade, hesitated
for a moment, reflecting whether he might not compromise
himself politically by going to the sub-prefect's in this way,
but as the night was very black, and his daughter Aurélie
was most anxious to have the truth of her report manifested,
he followed Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies with stealthy
steps through the darkness. It was in this manner that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
representative of Legitimacy at Plassans for the first time
entered the grounds of a Bonapartist official.</p>

<p>'Don't make a noise,' whispered the sub-prefect. 'Lean
over the terrace.'</p>

<p>There Monsieur Rastoil and his daughters found Doctor
Porquier and Madame de Condamin and her husband. The
darkness was so dense that they exchanged salutations without
being able to see one another. Then they all held their
breath. Mouret had just appeared upon the steps, with a
candle, which was stuck in a great kitchen candlestick.</p>

<p>'You see he has got a candle,' whispered Aurélie.</p>

<p>No one dissented. The fact was quite incontrovertible;
Mouret certainly was carrying a candle. He came slowly
down the steps, turned to the left and then stood motionless
before a bed of lettuces. Then he raised his candle to throw
a light upon the plants. His face looked quite yellow
amidst the black night.</p>

<p>'What a dreadful face!' exclaimed Madame de Condamin.
'I shall dream of it, I'm certain. Is he asleep, doctor?'</p>

<p>'No, no,' replied Doctor Porquier, 'he is not a somnambulist;
he is wide awake. Do you notice how fixed his
gaze is? Observe, too, the abruptness of his movements&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Hush! hush!' interrupted Monsieur Péqueur des
Saulaies; 'we don't require a lecture just now.'</p>

<p>The most complete silence then fell. Mouret had
stridden over the box-edging and was kneeling in the midst
of the lettuces. He held his candle down, and began searching
along the trenches underneath the spreading leaves of the
plants. Every now and then he made a slight examination
and seemed to be crushing something and stamping it into
the ground. This went on for nearly half an hour.</p>

<p>'He is crying; it is just as I told you,' Aurélie complacently
remarked.</p>

<p>'It is really very terrifying,' Madame de Condamin exclaimed
nervously. 'Pray let us go back into the house.'</p>

<p>Mouret dropped his candle and it went out. They could
hear him uttering exclamations of annoyance as he went back
up the steps, stumbling against them in the dark. The
Rastoil girls broke out into little cries of terror, and did not
quite recover from their fright till they were again in the
brightly lighted drawing-room, where Monsieur Péqueur
des Saulaies insisted upon the company refreshing themselves
with some tea and biscuits. Madame de Condamin, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
still trembling with alarm, huddled up on a couch, said, with
a touching smile, that she had never felt so overcome before,
not even on the morning when she had had the reprehensible
curiosity to go and see a criminal executed.</p>

<p>'It is strange,' remarked Monsieur Rastoil, who had been
buried in thought for a moment or two; 'but Mouret looked
as if he were searching for slugs amongst his lettuces. The
gardens are quite ravaged by them, and I have been told that
they can only be satisfactorily exterminated in the night-time.'</p>

<p>'Slugs, indeed!' cried Monsieur de Condamin. 'Do you
suppose he troubles himself about slugs? Do people go
hunting for slugs with a candle? No; I agree with Monsieur
Maffre in thinking that there is some crime at the bottom of
the matter. Did this man Mouret ever have a servant who
disappeared mysteriously? There ought to be an inquiry
made.'</p>

<p>Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies thought that his friend the
conservator of rivers and forests was theorising a little further
than the facts warranted. He took a sip at his tea and said:</p>

<p>'No, no; my dear sir. He is mad and has extraordinary
fancies, but that is all. It is quite bad enough as it is.'</p>

<p>He then took a plate of biscuits, handed it to Monsieur
Rastoil's daughter with a gallant bow, and after putting it
down again continued:</p>

<p>'And to think this wretched man has mixed himself up in
politics! I don't want to insinuate anything against your
alliance with the Republicans, my dear judge, but you must
allow that in Mouret the Marquis de Lagrifoul had a very
peculiar supporter.'</p>

<p>Monsieur Rastoil, who had become very grave, made a
vague gesture, without saying anything.</p>

<p>'And he still busies himself with these matters. It is
politics, perhaps, which have turned his brain,' said the fair
Octavie, as she delicately wiped her lips. 'They say he takes
the greatest interest in the approaching elections, don't they,
my dear?'</p>

<p>She addressed this question to her husband, casting a
glance at him as she spoke.</p>

<p>'He is quite bursting over the matter!' cried Monsieur
de Condamin. 'He declares that he can entirely control the
election, and can have a shoemaker returned if he chooses.'</p>

<p>'You are exaggerating,' said Doctor Porquier. 'He no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
longer has the influence he used to have; the whole town
jeers at him.'</p>

<p>'Ah! you are mistaken! If he chooses, he can lead the
old quarter of the town and a great number of villages to the
poll. He is mad, it is true, but that is a recommendation.
I myself consider him still a very sensible person, for a
Republican.'</p>

<p>This attempt at wit met with distinct success. Monsieur
Rastoil's daughters broke out into school-girl laughs and the
presiding judge himself nodded his head in approval. He
threw off his serious expression, and, without looking at the
sub-prefect, he said:</p>

<p>'Lagrifoul has not rendered us, perhaps, the services we
had a right to expect, but a shoemaker would be really too
disgraceful for Plassans!'</p>

<p>Then, as though he wanted to prevent any further remarks
on the subject, he added quickly: 'Why, it is half-past one
o'clock! This is quite an orgie we are having, my dear sub-prefect;
we are all very much obliged to you.'</p>

<p>Madame de Condamin wrapped her shawl round her
shoulders and contrived to have the last word.</p>

<p>'Well,' she said, 'we really must not let the election be
controlled by a man who goes and kneels down in the middle
of a bed of lettuces after twelve o'clock at night.'</p>

<p>That night became quite historical, and Monsieur de Condamin
derived much amusement from relating the details of
what had occurred to Monsieur de Bourdeu, Monsieur Maffre,
and the priests, who had not seen Mouret with his candle.
Three days later all the neighbourhood was asserting that the
madman who beat his wife had been seen walking about with
his head enveloped in a sheet. Meantime, the afternoon
assemblies under the arbour were much exercised by the
possible candidature of Mouret's radical shoemaker. They
laughed as they studied each other's demeanour. It was a
sort of political pulse-feeling. Certain confidential statements
of his friend the presiding judge induced Monsieur de Bourdeu
to believe that a tacit understanding might be arrived at
between the Sub-Prefecture and the moderate opposition to
promote the candidature of himself, and thus inflict a crushing
defeat upon the Republicans. Possessed by this idea, he
waxed more and more sarcastic against the Marquis de
Lagrifoul, and made the most of the latter's blunders in the
Chamber. Monsieur Delangre, who only called at long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
intervals, alleging the pressure of his municipal duties as an
excuse for his infrequent appearance, smiled softly at each
fresh sally of the ex-prefect.</p>

<p>'You've only got to bury the marquis, now, your reverence,'
he said one day in Abbé Faujas's ear.</p>

<p>Madame de Condamin, who heard him, turned her head
and laid her finger upon her lips with a pretty look of mischief.</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas now allowed politics to be mentioned in his
presence. He even occasionally expressed an opinion in
favour of the union of all honest and religious men. Thereupon
all present, Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies, Monsieur
Rastoil, Monsieur de Bourdeu, and even Monsieur Maffre,
grew quite warm in their expressions of desire for such an
agreement. It would be so very easy, they said, for men with
a stake in the country to come to an understanding together
to work for the firm establishment of the great principles
without which no society could hold together. Then the
conversation turned upon property, and family and religion.
Sometimes Mouret's name was mentioned, and Monsieur de
Condamin once said:</p>

<p>'I never let my wife come here without feeling uneasy.
I am really getting alarmed. You will see some strange
things happen at the next elections if that man is still at
liberty.'</p>

<p>Trouche did his best to frighten Abbé Faujas during the
interviews which he had with him every morning. He told
him the most alarming stories. The working men of the old
quarter of the town, said he, were showing too much interest
in Mouret; they talked of coming to see him, of judging his
condition for themselves, and taking his advice.</p>

<p>As a rule, the priest merely shrugged his shoulders; but
one day Trouche came away from him looking quite
delighted. He went off to Olympe and kissed her, exclaiming:</p>

<p>'This time, my dear, I've managed it!'</p>

<p>'Has he given you leave?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Yes, full leave. We shall be delightfully comfortable
when we have got rid of the old man.'</p>

<p>Olympe was still in bed. She dived under the bed-clothes,
and wriggled about and laughed gleefully.</p>

<p>'We shall have everything to do as we like with, then,
sha'n't we? I shall take another bedroom, and go out into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
the garden whenever I like, and do all my cooking in the
kitchen. My brother will have to let us do all that. You
must have managed to frighten him very much.'</p>

<p>It was not till about ten o'clock that evening that Trouche
made his appearance at the low café where he was accustomed
to meet Guillaume Porquier and other wild young fellows.
They joked him about the lateness of the hour, and playfully
accused him of having been out on the ramparts courting one
of the girls of the Home of the Virgin. Jests of this kind generally
pleased him, but that night he remained very grave. He
declared that he had been engaged with business&mdash;very serious
business. It was only about midnight, when he had emptied
the decanters on the counter, that he became more expansive.
Then he began to talk familiarly to Guillaume, leaning the
while against the wall, stammering, and lighting his pipe
afresh between every two sentences.</p>

<p>'I saw your father this evening. He is a very good
fellow. I wanted a paper from him. He was very kind, very
kind indeed. He gave it to me. I have it here in my pocket.
He didn't want to give it me at first, though. He said it was
only the family's business. But I told him, "I am the family;
I have got the wife's orders." You know her, don't you? a
dear little woman. She seemed quite pleased when I went to
talk the matter over with her beforehand. Then he gave me
the paper. You can feel it here in my pocket.'</p>

<p>Guillaume looked at him, concealing his extreme curiosity
with an incredulous laugh.</p>

<p>'I'm telling you the truth,' continued the drunkard.
'The paper's here in my pocket. Can't you feel it?'</p>

<p>'Oh, it's only a newspaper!' said Guillaume.</p>

<p>At this, Trouche sniggered, and drew a large envelope
from the pocket of his overcoat, and laid it on the table amidst
the cups and glasses. For a moment, though Guillaume
had reached out his hand, he prevented him from taking it,
but then he allowed him to have it, laughing loudly the
while. The paper proved to be a most detailed statement
by Doctor Porquier with respect to the mental condition of
François Mouret, householder, of Plassans.</p>

<p>'Are they going to shut him up, then?' asked Guillaume,
handing back the paper.</p>

<p>'That's no business of yours, my boy,' replied Trouche,
who had now become distrustful again. 'This paper here is
for his wife. I am merely a friend who is glad to do a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
service. She will act as she pleases. However, she can't go
on letting herself be half murdered, poor lady!'</p>

<p>By the time they were turned out of the café he was so
drunk that Guillaume had to accompany him to the Rue
Balande. He wanted to lie down and go to sleep on every
seat on the Cours Sauvaire. When they reached the Place of
the Sub-Prefecture, he began to shed tears and stutter:</p>

<p>'I've no friends now; everyone despises me just because
I'm poor. But you are a good-hearted young fellow, and you
shall come and have coffee with us when we get into possession.
If the Abbé interferes with us, we'll send him to keep
the other one company. He isn't very sharp, the Abbé, in
spite of all his grand airs. I can persuade him into believing
anything. But you are a real friend, aren't you? Mouret is
done for, old chap; we'll drink his wine together.'</p>

<p>When Guillaume had seen Trouche to his door, he walked
back through the sleeping town and went and whistled softly
before Monsieur Maffre's house. It was a signal he was
making. The young Maffres, whom their father locked up in
their bedroom, opened a window on the first floor and descended
to the ground by the help of the bars with which the
ground-floor windows were protected. Every night they thus
went off to the haunts of vice in the company of Guillaume
Porquier.</p>

<p>'Well,' he said to them, when they had reached the dark
paths near the ramparts, 'we needn't trouble ourselves now.
If my father talks any more about sending me off anywhere,
I shall have something serious to say to him. I'll bet you
that I can get elected into the Young Men's Club whenever I
like now.'</p>

<p>The following night Marthe had a dreadful attack. She
had been present in the morning at a long religious ceremony,
the whole of which Olympe had insisted upon seeing. When
Rose and the lodgers ran into the room upon hearing her
piercing screams, they found her lying at the foot of the bed
with her forehead gashed open. Mouret was kneeling in the
midst of the bed-clothes, trembling all over.</p>

<p>'He has killed her this time!' cried the cook.</p>

<p>She seized Mouret in her arms, although he was in his
night-dress, pushed him out of the room and into his office&mdash;the
door of which was on the other side of the landing&mdash;then
she went back to get a mattress and some blankets, which
she threw to him. Trouche had set off at a run for Doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Porquier. When the doctor arrived he dressed Marthe's
wound. If the cut had been a trifle lower down, he said, it
would have been fatal. Downstairs in the hall, he declared
in the presence of them all that it was necessary to take
some active steps, and that Madame Mouret's life could no
longer be left at the mercy of a violent madman.</p>

<p>The next morning Marthe was obliged to keep her bed.
She was still slightly delirious, and fancied that she saw an
iron hand driving a flaming sword into her skull. Rose absolutely
declined to allow Mouret to enter the room. She
served him his lunch on a dusty table in his own office. He
was still gazing at his plate with a look of stupefaction when
Rose ushered into the room three men dressed in black.</p>

<p>'Are you the doctors?' he asked. 'How is she getting
on?'</p>

<p>'She is better than she was,' replied one of the men.</p>

<p>Mouret began to cut his bread mechanically as though he
were going to eat it.</p>

<p>'I wish the children were here,' he said. 'They would
look after her, and we should be more lively. It is since the
children went away that she has been ill. I am no longer
good for anything.'</p>

<p>He raised a piece of bread to his mouth, and heavy tears
trickled down his face. The man who had already spoken to
him now said, casting at the same time a glance at his
companions:</p>

<p>'Shall we go and fetch your children?'</p>

<p>'I should like it very much,' replied Mouret, rising from
his seat. 'Let us start at once.'</p>

<p>As he went downstairs he saw no one except Trouche and
his wife, who were leaning over the balustrade on the second
floor, following each step he took with gleaming eyes.
Olympe hurried down behind him and rushed into the kitchen,
where Rose, in a state of great emotion, was watching out of
the window. When a carriage, which was waiting at the
door, had driven off with Mouret, she sprang up the staircase
again, four steps at a time, and seizing Trouche by his
shoulders, made him dance round the landing in a paroxysm
of delight.</p>

<p>'He's packed off!' she cried.</p>

<p>Marthe kept her bed for a week. Her mother came to see
her every afternoon and manifested the greatest affection.
The Faujases and the Trouches succeeded each other in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
attendance at her bedside; and even Madame de Condamin
called to see her several times. Nothing was said about
Mouret, and Rose told her mistress that she thought he had
gone to Marseilles. When Marthe, however, was able to
come downstairs again, and took her place at table in the
dining-room, she began to manifest some astonishment, and
inquired uneasily where her husband was.</p>

<p>'Now, my dear lady, don't distress yourself,' said Madame
Faujas, 'or you will make yourself ill again. It was absolutely
necessary that something should be done, and your
friends felt bound to consult together and take steps for your
protection.'</p>

<p>'You've no reason to regret him, I'm sure,' cried Rose
harshly. 'The whole neighbourhood breathes more freely
now that he's no longer here. One was always afraid of him
setting the place on fire or rushing out into the street with a
knife. I used to hide all the knives in my kitchen and
Monsieur Rastoil's cook did the same. And your poor mother
nearly died of fright. Everybody who has been here while
you have been ill, those ladies and gentlemen, they all said to
me as I let them out, "It is a good riddance for Plassans."
A place is always on the alert when a man like that is free to
go about as he likes.'</p>

<p>Marthe listened to this stream of words with dilated eyes
and pale face. She had let her spoon fall from her hand, and
she gazed out of the window in front of her as though some
dreadful vision rising from behind the fruit-trees in the garden
was filling her with terror.</p>

<p>'Les Tulettes! Les Tulettes!' she gasped, as she buried
her face in her trembling hands.</p>

<p>She fell backwards and was fainting away, when Abbé
Faujas, who had finished his soup, grasped her hands, pressing
them tightly, and saying in his softest tone:</p>

<p>'Show yourself strong before this trial which God is
sending you. He will afford you consolation if you do not
prove rebellious&mdash;He will grant you the happiness you deserve.'</p>

<p>At the pressure of the priest's hands and the tender tone
of his voice, Marthe revived and sat up again with flushing
cheeks.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes!' she cried, as she burst into sobs, 'I have great
need of happiness; promise me great happiness, I beg you.'</p>

<h3><a name="XIX" id="XIX">XIX</a></h3>


<p>The general elections were to take place in October. About
the middle of September, Monseigneur Rousselot suddenly set
off to Paris, after having a long interview with Abbé Faujas.
It was said that one of his sisters, who lived at Versailles, was
seriously ill. Five days later he was back in Plassans again,
and he called Abbé Surin into his study to read to him.
Lying back in his easy chair, closely enveloped in a padded
robe of violet silk, although the weather was still quite warm,
he smilingly listened to the young Abbé's womanish voice as
he softly lisped the strophes of Anacreon.</p>

<p>'Good, very good,' he said; 'you express the music of that
beautiful tongue excellently.'</p>

<p>Then, glancing at the timepiece with an expression of
uneasiness, he added:</p>

<p>'Has Abbé Faujas been here yet this morning? Ah, my
child, what a dreadful time I've had! My ears are still
buzzing with the abominable uproar of the railway. It was
raining the whole time I was in Paris. I had to rush all over
the place, and saw nothing but mud everywhere.'</p>

<p>Abbé Surin laid his book on the corner of a small table.</p>

<p>'Is your lordship satisfied with the results of your journey?'
he asked, with the familiarity of a petted favourite.</p>

<p>'I have learnt what I wanted to know,' the Bishop replied
with his subtle smile. 'I ought to have taken you with me.
You would have learnt a good many things that it would be
useful for you to know at your age, destined as you are by
your birth and connections for the episcopate.'</p>

<p>'I am listening, my lord,' said the young priest with a
beseeching expression.</p>

<p>But the prelate shook his head.</p>

<p>'No, no; these matters are not to be spoken of. Make a
friend of Abbé Faujas. He maybe able to do much for you
some day. I have received full information about him.'</p>

<p>Abbé Surin, however, clasped his hands with such a
wheedling look of curiosity that Monseigneur Rousselot went
on to say:</p>

<p>'He had some bother or other at Besançon. Afterwards
he was living in great poverty in furnished apartments in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Paris. He went and offered himself. Just at that time the
minister was on the look-out for some priests devoted to the
government. I was told that Faujas at first quite frightened
him with his fierce looks and his old cassock. It was quite
by chance that he was sent here. The minister was most
pleasant and courteous to me.'</p>

<p>The Bishop finished his sentences with a slight wave of
his hand, as he sought for fitting words, fearing, as it were, to
say too much. But at last the affection which he felt for his
secretary got the better of his caution, and he continued with
more animation:</p>

<p>'Take my advice and try to be useful to the vicar of Saint-Saturnin's.
He will want all the assistance he can get, and
he seems to me to be a man who never forgets either an
injury or a kindness. But don't ally yourself with him. He
will end badly. That is my impression.'</p>

<p>'End badly?' exclaimed the young priest in surprise.</p>

<p>'Oh! just now he is in the full swing of triumph. But
his face disquiets me, my child. He has a terrible face. That
man will never die in his bed. Don't you do anything to
compromise me. All I ask is to be allowed to live tranquilly&mdash;quietness
is all I want.'</p>

<p>Abbé Surin was just taking up his book again, when Abbé
Faujas was announced. Monseigneur Rousselot advanced to
meet him with outstretched hands and a smiling face, addressing
him as his 'dear Curé.'</p>

<p>'Leave us, my child,' he said to his secretary, who thereupon
retired.</p>

<p>He spoke of his journey. His sister was better than she
had been, he said, and he had been able to shake hands with
some old friends.</p>

<p>'And did you see the minister?' asked Abbé Faujas,
fixing his eyes upon him.</p>

<p>'Yes; I thought it my duty to call upon him,' replied
the Bishop, who felt that he was blushing. 'He spoke to me
very favourably indeed of you.'</p>

<p>'Then you no longer have any doubts&mdash;you trust me absolutely?'</p>

<p>'Absolutely, my dear Curé. Besides, I know nothing about
politics myself, and I leave everything in your hands.'</p>

<p>They remained talking together the whole morning. Abbé
Faujas persuaded the Bishop to undertake a visitation of his
diocese, and said he would go with him and prompt him as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
what he should say. It would be necessary to summon all
the rural deans so that the priests of the smallest villages
might receive their instructions. There would be no difficulty
in all this, for the clergy would act as they were told. The
most delicate task would be in Plassans itself, in the district
of Saint-Marc. The aristocrats there, shutting themselves
up in the privacy of their houses, were entirely beyond the
reach of Abbé Faujas's influence, and he had so far only been
able to work upon certain ambitious royalists, such men as
Rastoil and Maffre and Bourdeu. The Bishop, however,
undertook to sound the feelings of various drawing-rooms in
the district of Saint-Marc where he visited. But even allowing
that the aristocracy should vote adversely, they would be in a
ridiculous minority if they were deserted by those electors of
the middle classes who were amenable to clerical influence.</p>

<p>'Now,' said Monseigneur Rousselot as he rose from his
seat, 'it would perhaps be as well if you told me the name of
your candidate, so that I may recommend him in my letters.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas smiled.</p>

<p>'It is dangerous to mention names,' he said. 'There
wouldn't be a scrap of our candidate left in a week's time if
we made his name known now. The Marquis de Lagrifoul
has become quite out of the question. Monsieur de Bourdeu,
who reckons upon being a candidate, is still more so. We
shall leave them to destroy each other, and then, at the last
moment, we shall come forward. Just say that an election
on purely political grounds would be very regrettable, and that
what is needed for the interests of Plassans is somebody who
is not a party man, but has an intimate knowledge of the requirements
of the town and the department. And you may
let it be understood that such a man has been found; but
don't go any further.'</p>

<p>The Bishop now in his turn smiled. He detained the
priest for a moment as he was about to take leave.</p>

<p>'And Abbé Fenil?' he said, lowering his voice. 'Are
you not afraid that he will do all he can to thwart your
plans?'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>'He has made no sign at all,' he said.</p>

<p>'It is precisely that quietness of his that makes me uneasy,'
rejoined the prelate. 'I know Fenil well. He is the
most vindictive priest in my diocese. He may possibly have
abandoned the ambition of beating you in the political arena,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
but you may be sure he will wreak personal vengeance upon
you. I have no doubt that he is keeping a watch on you in
his retirement.'</p>

<p>'Pooh!' said Abbé Faujas, showing his white teeth. 'I'll
take care that he doesn't eat me up.'</p>

<p>Abbé Surin had just returned into the room, and when the
vicar of Saint-Saturnin's had gone he made the Bishop laugh
by exclaiming:</p>

<p>'Ah! if they could only devour each other like a couple
of foxes, and leave nothing but their tails!'</p>

<p>The electoral campaign was on the point of commencing.
Plassans, which generally remained quite calm, unexcited by
political questions, was growing a little feverish and perturbed.
From some invisible mouth a breath of war seemed
to sweep through its quiet streets. The Marquis de Lagrifoul,
who lived at La Palud, a large straggling village in the
neighbourhood, had been in Plassans for the last fortnight,
staying at the house of a relative of his, the Count de Valqueyras,
whose mansion was one of the largest in the Saint-Marc
district. The Marquis showed himself about the town,
promenaded on the Cours Sauvaire, attended Saint-Saturnin's,
and bowed to sundry influential townspeople, but without
succeeding in throwing aside his haughty ways. His attempts
to acquire popularity seemed to fail. Fresh charges against
him, originating from some unknown source, were bandied
about every day. It was asserted that he was a miserably
incompetent man. With any other representative Plassans
would long ago have had a branch line of railway connecting
it with Nice. It was said, too, that if anyone from the district
went to see him in Paris he had to call three or four times
before he could obtain the slightest service. However, although
the candidature of the Marquis was much damaged
by gossip of this kind, no other candidate had openly entered
the lists. There was some talk of Monsieur de Bourdeu
coming forward, though it was considered that it would be
extremely difficult to obtain a majority for an ex-prefect of
Louis-Philippe, who had no strong connection with the place.
There seemed also to be some unknown influence at work in
Plassans upsetting all the previous prospects of the election
by breaking the alliance between the Legitimists and the Republicans.
The prevailing feeling was one of general perplexity
and confusion, mingled with weariness and a desire to
get the affair over as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>'The majority is shifting,' said the politicians of the
Cours Sauvaire. 'The question is which way will it finally
incline?'</p>

<p>Amid the excitement and restlessness which this doubtful
state of things was causing in the town, the Republicans became
anxious to run a candidate of their own. Their choice
fell upon a master-hatter, one Maurin, a plain simple man,
who was very much liked by the working-classes. In the cafés,
in the evenings, Trouche expressed an opinion that Maurin
was by no means sufficiently advanced in his views, and
proposed in his stead a wheelwright of Les Tulettes, whose
name had appeared in the list of the December proscripts.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
This man, however, had the good sense to decline the nomination.
It should be said that Trouche now gave himself
out as an extreme Republican. He would have come forward
himself, he said, if his wife's brother had not been a parson,
but as he was&mdash;to his great regret, he declared&mdash;forced to eat
the bread of the hypocrites, he felt bound to remain in the
background. He was one of the first to circulate reports to
the detriment of the Marquis de Lagrifoul, and he also
favoured the rupture of the Republicans and the Legitimists.
Trouche's greatest success was obtained by accusing the Sub-Prefecture
party and the adherents of Monsieur Rastoil of
having brought about the confinement of poor Mouret, with
the view of depriving the democratic party of one of its
worthiest chiefs. On the evening when he first launched
this accusation at a spirit-dealer's in the Rue Canquoin, the
company assembled there looked at one other with a peculiar
expression. The gossips of the old quarter of the town spoke
quite feelingly about 'the madman who beat his wife,' now
that he was shut up at Les Tulettes, and told one another
that Abbé Faujas had simply wanted to get an inconvenient
husband out of his way. Trouche repeated his charge every
evening, banging his fists upon the tables of the cafés with
such an air of conviction that he succeeded in persuading his
listeners of the truth of his story, in which, by the way, Monsieur
Péqueur des Saulaies was made to play the most extraordinary
part imaginable. There was a complete reaction in
Mouret's favour. He was considered to be a political victim,
a man whose influence had been feared so much that he had
been put out of the way in a cell at a mad-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>'Just leave it all to me,' Trouche said with a confidential
air. 'I'll expose all these precious pious folks, and I'll tell
some fine stories about their Home of the Virgin. It's a nice
place is that Home&mdash;a place where the ladies make assignations!'</p>

<p>Meanwhile Abbé Faujas almost seemed to have the power
of multiplying himself. For some time past he was to be
seen everywhere. He bestowed much attention upon his
appearance, and was careful always to have a pleasant smile
upon his face; though now and then his eyelids dropped for
an instant to hide the stern fire kindling in his glance. Often
with his patience quite worn out, weary of his wretched struggles,
he returned to his bare room with clenched fists. Old
Madame Rougon, whom he continued to see in secret, proved
his good genius. She lectured him soundly whenever he felt
despondent, and kept him bent before her while she told him
that he must strive to please, and that he would ruin everything
if he let the iron hand appear from under the velvet
glove. Afterwards, when he had made himself master, he
might seize Plassans by the throat and strangle it, if he liked.
She herself certainly had no great affection for Plassans,
against which she owed a grudge for forty years' wretchedness,
and which had been bursting with jealousy of her ever since
the Coup d'État.</p>

<p>'It is I who wear the cassock,' she said sometimes, with a
smile; 'you carry yourself like a gendarme, my dear Curé.'</p>

<p>The priest showed himself particularly assiduous in his
attendance at the Young Men's Club. He listened with an
indulgent air to the young men talking politics, and told them,
with a shake of his head, that honesty was all that was necessary.
His popularity at the Club was still increasing. One
evening he consented to play at billiards, and showed himself
extremely skilful at the game, and sometimes, when they
formed a quiet little party, he would even accept a cigarette.
The club took his advice on every question that arose. His
reputation for tolerance was completely established by the
kind, good-natured way in which he advocated the admission
of Guillaume Porquier, who had now renewed his application.</p>

<p>'I have seen the young man,' he said; 'he came to me
to make a general confession, and I ended by giving him
absolution. There is forgiveness for every sin. We must
not treat him as a leper just because he pulled down a few
signboards in Plassans, and ran into debt at Paris.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>When Guillaume was elected, he said to the young
Maffres, with a grin:</p>

<p>'Well, you owe me a couple of bottles of champagne now.
You see that the Curé does all that I want. I have a little
machine to tickle him with in a sensitive place, and then he
begins to laugh, my boys, and he can't refuse me anything.'</p>

<p>'Well, it doesn't seem as though he were very fond of
you, anyhow,' said Alphonse; 'he looks very sourly at you.'</p>

<p>'Pooh! that's because I tickled him too hard. You will
see that we shall soon be the best friends in the world.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas did, indeed, seem to have an affection for the
doctor's son. He declared that this young man wanted
guiding with a very gentle hand. In a short time Guillaume
became the moving spirit of the club. He invented amusements,
showed them how to make kirsch-water punch, and
led young fellows fresh from college into all sorts of dissipation.
His pleasant vices gave him enormous influence.
While the organ was pealing above the billiard-room, he
drank away, and gathered round him the sons of the most
respectable people in Plassans, making them almost choke with
laughter at his broad stories. The club now got into a very
fast way, indulging in doubtful topics of conversation in all
the corners. Abbé Faujas, however, appeared quite unconscious
of it. Guillaume said that he had a splendid noddle,
teeming with the greatest thoughts.</p>

<p>'The Abbé may be a bishop whenever he likes,' he
remarked. 'He has already refused a living in Paris. He
wants to stay at Plassans; he has taken a liking to the place.
I should like to nominate him as deputy. He's the sort of
man we want in the Chamber! But he would never consent;
he is too modest. Still it would be a good thing to take his
advice when the elections are at hand. We may trust anything
that he tells us. He wouldn't deceive anybody.'</p>

<p>Meantime, Lucien Delangre remained the serious man of
the club. He showed great deference to Abbé Faujas, and
won the group of studious young men over to the priest's side.
He frequently walked with him to the club, talking to him
with much animation, but subsiding into silence as soon as
they entered the general room.</p>

<p>On leaving the café established beneath the Church of the
Minimes, the Abbé regularly went to the Home of the Virgin.
He arrived there during play-time, and made his appearance
with a smiling face upon the steps of the playground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Thereupon the girls surrounded him, and disputed with each
other for the possession of his pockets, in which some sacred
pictures or chaplets or medals that had been blessed were
always to be found. Those big girls quite worshipped him as
he tapped them gently on their cheeks and told them to be
good, at which they broke into sly smiles. The Sisters often
complained to him that the children confided to their care
were utterly unmanageable, that they fought, tore each
other's hair, and did even worse things. The Abbé, however,
regarded their offences as mere peccadilloes, and as a
rule simply reproved the more turbulent girls in the chapel,
whence they emerged in a more submissive frame of mind.
Occasionally he made some rather graver piece of misconduct
a pretext for sending for the parents, whom he sent away
again quite touched by his kindness and good-nature. In
this wise the young scapegraces of the Home of the Virgin
gained him the hearts of the poor families of Plassans. When
they went home in the evening, they told the most wonderful
things about his reverence the Curé. It was no uncommon
occurrence to find a couple of them in some secluded corner of
the ramparts on the point of coming to blows to decide which
of them his reverence liked the better.</p>

<p>'Those young hussies represent from two to three
thousand votes,' Trouche thought to himself, as from the
window he watched Abbé Faujas showing himself so amiable.</p>

<p>Trouche himself had tried to win over 'the little dears,'
as he called the girls; but the priest, distrusting him, had
forbidden him to set foot in the playground; and so he now
confined himself to throwing sugar-plums there, when the
Sisters' backs were turned.</p>

<p>The Abbé's day's work did not end at the Home of the
Virgin. From there he started on a series of short visits to
the fashionable ladies of Plassans. Madame Rastoil and
Madame Delangre welcomed him with delight, and repeated
his slightest words everywhere. But his great friend was
Madame de Condamin. She maintained an air of easy
familiarity towards him betokening the superiority of a
beautiful woman who is conscious that she is all-powerful.
She spoke now and again in low tones, and with meaning
smiles and glances, which seemed to indicate that there was
some secret understanding between them. When the priest
came to see her, she dismissed her husband. 'The government
was going to hold a cabinet-council,' so the conservator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
of rivers and forests playfully said, as he philosophically went
off to mount his horse.</p>

<p>It was Madame Rougon who had brought Madame de
Condamin to the priest's notice.</p>

<p>'She has not yet absolutely established her position here,'
the old lady explained to Abbé Faujas. 'But there is a good
deal of cleverness under those pretty, coquettish airs of hers.
You can take her into your confidence, and she will see in
your triumph a means of making her own success and power
more complete. She will be of great use to you if you should
find it necessary to give away places or crosses. She has
retained an influential friend in Paris, who sends her as many
red ribbons as she asks for.'</p>

<p>As Madame Rougon kept herself aloof from reasons of
diplomacy, the fair Octavie thus became Abbé Faujas's most
active ally. She won over to his side both her friends and
her friends' friends. She resumed her campaign afresh every
morning and exerted an astonishing amount of influence
merely by the pleasant little waves of her delicately gloved
fingers. She had particular success with the <i>bourgeoises</i>, and
increased tenfold that feminine influence of which the priest
had felt the absolute necessity as soon as he began to thread
the narrow world of Plassans. She succeeded, too, in closing
the mouths of the Paloques&mdash;who were growing very rabid
about the state of affairs at the Mourets' house&mdash;by throwing a
honied cake to the two monsters.</p>

<p>'What! do you still bear us a grudge, my dear lady?' she
said one day, as she met the judge's wife. 'It is very wrong of
you. Your friends have not forgotten you; they are thinking
about you and are preparing a surprise for you.'</p>

<p>'A fine surprise, I'll be bound!' cried Madame Paloque,
bitterly. 'No, we are not going to allow ourselves to be
laughed at again. I have firmly made up my mind to keep to
my own affairs.'</p>

<p>Madame de Condamin smiled.</p>

<p>'What would you say,' she asked, 'if Monsieur Paloque
were to be decorated?'</p>

<p>The judge's wife stared in silence. A rush of blood to her
face turned it quite blue, and made her terrible to behold.</p>

<p>'You are joking,' she stammered. 'This is only another
plot against us&mdash;if it isn't true, I'll never forgive you.'</p>

<p>The fair Octavie swore that she had spoken nothing but
the truth. The distinction would certainly be conferred upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
Monsieur Paloque, but it would not be officially notified in
the 'Moniteur' until after the elections, as the government
did not wish it to appear as if it were buying the support of
the magistracy. She also hinted that Abbé Faujas was not
unconcerned in the bestowal of this long-desired reward, and
said that he had talked about it to the sub-prefect.</p>

<p>'My husband was right, then,' exclaimed Madame Paloque,
in great surprise. 'For a long time past he has been
worrying me dreadfully to go and apologise to the Abbé. But
I am very obstinate, and I would have let myself be killed
sooner. But since the Abbé makes the first move&mdash;well, we
ask nothing more than to live at peace with everyone.
We will go to the Sub-Prefecture to-morrow.'</p>

<p>The next day the Paloques were very humble. Madame
Paloque accused Abbé Fenil of the blackest conduct; and
related with consummate impudence how she had gone to
see him one day, and how he had spoken in her presence of
turning 'the whole of Abbé Faujas's clique' neck-and-crop
out of Plassans.</p>

<p>'If you like,' she said to the priest, taking him aside, 'I
will give you a note written at the vicar-general's dictation.
It concerns you. He tried, I believe, to get several discreditable
stories inserted in the "Plassans Gazette."'</p>

<p>'How did this note come into your hands?' asked Faujas.</p>

<p>'Well, it's sufficient that it is there,' she replied, without
any sign of embarrassment.</p>

<p>And, with a smile, she continued:</p>

<p>'I found it. I recollect, by the way, that there are two or
three words written in the vicar-general's own hand. I may
trust to your honour in all this, may I not? We are upright,
honest people, and we don't want to compromise ourselves.'</p>

<p>She pretended to be affected by scruples for three days
before bringing him the note; and Madame de Condamin was
obliged to assure her privately that an application to have
Monsieur Rastoil pensioned off would shortly be made, so that
her husband could succeed to his post. Then she gave up
the paper. Abbé Faujas did not wish to keep it himself, but
took it to Madame Rougon, and charged her to make use of
it&mdash;keeping herself, however, strictly in the background&mdash;if
the vicar-general showed the slightest sign of interfering in
the elections.</p>

<p>Madame de Condamin also dropped a hint to Monsieur
Maffre that the Emperor was thinking about decorating him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
and she made a formal promise to Doctor Porquier to find a
suitable post for his good-for-nothing son. She showed the
most obliging kindliness at the friendly afternoon meetings in
the gardens. The summer was now drawing to a close, but
she still arrived in light toilettes, shivering slightly and risking
a cold, in order to show her arms and overcome the last
scruples of the Rastoil party. It was really under the Mourets'
arbour that the election was decided.</p>

<p>'Well, my dear sub-prefect,' said Abbé Faujas one day
with a smile, when the two sets of guests were mingling together;
'the great battle is drawing near.'</p>

<p>They had now arrived at discussing the political struggle
in a quiet friendly way. In the gardens at the back of the
houses they cordially grasped each other's hands, while in
front of them they still feigned an appearance of hostility.
On hearing Abbé Faujas, Madame de Condamin cast a quick
glance at Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies, who bent forward
with his habitual elegance and said all in a breath:</p>

<p>'I shall remain in my tent, Monsieur le Curé. I have
been fortunate enough to make his excellency understand that
it is the duty of the government, in the immediate interests
of Plassans, to hold itself aloof. There will be no official
candidate.'</p>

<p>Monsieur de Bourdeu turned pale. His eyelids quivered
and his hands trembled with delight.</p>

<p>'There will be no official candidate?' cried Monsieur
Rastoil, greatly moved by this unexpected news, and departing
from the reserve which he generally maintained.</p>

<p>'No,' replied Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies: 'the town
contains a sufficient number of honourable men to make its
own choice of a representative.'</p>

<p>He bowed slightly towards Monsieur de Bourdeu, who rose
from his seat; and stammered:</p>

<p>'Undoubtedly, undoubtedly.'</p>

<p>While these remarks were being exchanged Abbé Surin
had got up a game of 'hot and cold;' and Monsieur Rastoil's
daughters and Monsieur Maffre's sons and Séverin were busy
hunting for the Abbé's handkerchief, which he had rolled into
a ball and hidden. All the young people were flitting about
their elders, while the priest called in his falsetto voice:</p>

<p>'Hot! Hot!'</p>

<p>Angéline at length found the handkerchief in Doctor Porquier's
gaping pocket, where Abbé Surin had adroitly slipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
it. They all laughed and considered the selection of the
hiding-place a very ingenious joke.</p>

<p>'Bourdeu has a chance now,' said Monsieur Rastoil, taking
Abbé Faujas aside. 'It is very annoying. I can't tell him
so, but we sha'n't vote for him: he has compromised himself
too much as an Orleanist.'</p>

<p>'Just look at your son Séverin!' cried Madame de Condamin,
interrupting the conversation. 'What a big baby he
is! He put the handkerchief under Abbé Bourrette's hat.'</p>

<p>Then she lowered her voice as she continued:</p>

<p>'By the way, I have to congratulate you, Monsieur Rastoil.
I have received a letter from Paris, from a correspondent who
tells me that he has seen your son's name on an official list.
He will be nominated assessor to the public prosecutor at
Faverolles, I believe.'</p>

<p>The presiding judge bowed with a flushed face. The
minister had never forgiven the election of the Marquis de
Lagrifoul. Since then a kind of fatality had seemed to prevent
him from finding either a place for his son or husbands
for his daughters. He had never uttered any complaints, but
his compressed lips had often borne witness to his feelings on
the matter.</p>

<p>'I was remarking to you,' he resumed, to conceal his
emotion, 'that Bourdeu is dangerous. But he isn't a Plassans
man, and he doesn't know our requirements. We might just
as well re-elect the Marquis.'</p>

<p>'If Monsieur de Bourdeu persists in his candidature,' rejoined
Abbé Faujas, 'the Republicans will poll an imposing
minority, which will have a very bad effect.'</p>

<p>Madame de Condamin smiled. She pretended to understand
nothing about politics, and slipped away while the Abbé
drew the presiding judge aside to the end of the arbour, where
they continued the conversation in subdued tones. As they
slowly strolled back again, Monsieur Rastoil remarked:</p>

<p>'You are quite right. He would be a very suitable candidate.
He belongs to no party, and we could all unite in supporting
him. I am no fonder of the Empire than you are, but
it would be childish to go on sending deputies to the Chamber
for no other purpose than to obstruct and rail at the government.
Plassans is suffering from such tactics. What we want
is a man with a good head for business, a local man who can
look after the interests of the place.'</p>

<p>'Hot! Hot!' now cried Aurélie in her fluty voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>Abbé Surin passed through the arbour at the head of the
searchers, hunting for the handkerchief.</p>

<p>'Cold! Cold!' exclaimed the girl, laughing at their lack
of success. One of the young Maffres, however, lifted up a
flower-pot and there discovered the handkerchief folded in four.</p>

<p>'That big stick Aurélie might have very well crammed it
into her mouth,' said Madame Paloque. 'There is plenty of
room for it, and no one would ever have thought of looking for
it there.'</p>

<p>Her husband reduced her to silence with an angry look.
He would no longer allow her to indulge in bitter language.
Fearing that Monsieur de Condamin might have overheard
her, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>'What a handsome lot of young people!'</p>

<p>'Your success is certain, my dear sir,' the conservator of
rivers and forests was saying to Monsieur de Bourdeu. 'But
be careful what you do when you get to Paris. I hear from
a very trustworthy source that the government has resolved
upon taking strong measures if the opposition shows itself too
provoking.'</p>

<p>The ex-prefect looked at Monsieur de Condamin very
uneasily, wondering if he was making fun of him. Monsieur
Péqueur des Saulaies merely smiled, and stroked his moustaches.
Then the conversation became general again, and
Monsieur de Bourdeu thought he could detect that everyone
was congratulating him upon his approaching triumph, with
a discretion that was full of tact. He enjoyed the sweets of
an hour's imaginary popularity.</p>

<p>'It is surprising how much more quickly the grapes ripen
in the sun,' remarked Abbé Bourrette, who had never moved
from his chair, but now raised his eyes to the arbour.</p>

<p>'In the north,' Doctor Porquier explained, 'grapes can
often only be got to ripen by freeing them from the surrounding
leaves.'</p>

<p>They were beginning to discuss this point, when Séverin
in his turn cried out: 'Hot! Hot!'</p>

<p>But he had hung the handkerchief with such little concealment
upon the garden door that Abbé Surin found it at once.
When the Abbé hid it again, the whole troop vainly scoured
the garden for nearly half an hour, and at last gave it up.
Then the Abbé showed it to them lying in the centre of a flowerbed,
rolled up so artistically that it looked like a white stone.
This was the most effective stratagem of the afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>The news that the government had determined to run no
candidate of its own quickly spread through the town, where
it gave rise to great excitement. This abstention had the
natural effect of disquieting the various political sections, who
had each counted upon the diversion of a certain number of
votes in favour of the official candidate to enable their own
man to win. The Marquis de Lagrifoul, Monsieur de Bourdeu
and hatter Maurin appeared to divide the support of the
voters pretty equally amongst them. There would certainly
be a second ballot, and heaven only could tell what name
would then appear at the top of the list. However, there was
certainly some talk of a fourth candidate, whose name nobody
quite knew, some moderate equable man who would possibly
bring the different parties into concord and harmony. The
Plassans electors, who had grown a little alarmed since they
had felt the imperial bridle about their necks, would have
been only too glad to come to an understanding, and choose
one of their fellow-citizens who would be acceptable to all
parties.</p>

<p>'The government is wrong to treat us like refractory
children,' said the politicians of the Commercial Club, in
tones of annoyance. 'Anybody would suppose that the town
was a hot-bed of revolution. If the authorities had been
tactful enough to bring forward the right sort of candidate, we
should all have voted for him. The sub-prefect has talked
about a lesson. Well, we sha'n't receive the lesson. We
shall be able to find a candidate for ourselves, and we will
show that Plassans is a town of sound sense and true
liberty.'</p>

<p>They then began to look about for a candidate. But the
names which were proposed by friends or interested parties
only served to increase the confusion. In a week's time there
were twenty candidates before Plassans. Madame Rougon,
who had become very uneasy, and quite unable to understand
the position, went to see Abbé Faujas, full of indignation
with the sub-prefect. That Péqueur was an ass, she cried, a
fop, a dummy, of no use except as a pretty ornament to the
official drawing-room. He had already allowed the government
to be defeated, and now he was going to compromise it
by an attitude of ridiculous indifference.</p>

<p>'Make yourself easy,' said the priest, with a smile; 'this
time Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies is confining himself to
obeying orders. Victory is certain.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>'But you've got no candidate!' cried Madame Rougon.
'Where is your candidate?'</p>

<p>Then the priest unfolded his plans to her. She expressed
her approval of them; but she received the name
which he confided to her with the greatest surprise.</p>

<p>'What!' she exclaimed, 'you have chosen him! No one
has ever thought of him, I assure you.'</p>

<p>'I trust that they haven't,' replied the priest, again
smiling. 'We want a candidate of whom nobody has ever
thought, so that all parties may accept him without fancying
that they are compromising themselves.'</p>

<p>Then with the perfect frankness of a shrewd man who has
made up his mind to explain his designs, he continued:</p>

<p>'I have very much to thank you for. You have prevented
me from making many mistakes. I was looking straight
towards the goal, and I did not see the strings that were
stretched across the path, and which might, perhaps, have
tripped me up and brought me to grief. Thank heaven! all
this petty childish struggle is over, and I shall soon be able to
move at my ease. As for the choice I have made, it is a good
one; you may feel quite assured of that. Ever since my
arrival at Plassans, I have been looking about for a man, and
he is the only one I have found. He is flexible, very capable,
and very energetic. He has been clever enough not to embroil
himself with a single person in the place, which is no
common accomplishment. I know that you are not a very
great friend of his, and that is the reason that I did not confide
my plan to you sooner. But you will see that you are
mistaken, and that he will make his way rapidly as soon as
he gets his foot into the stirrup. What finally determined
me in his favour is what I heard about his means. It is said
that he has taken his wife back again three separate times,
after she had been detected in actual unfaithfulness, and after
he had made his good-natured father-in-law pay him a hundred
thousand francs on each occasion. If he has really
coined money in that way, he will be very useful in Paris in
certain matters. You may look about as much as you like;
but, putting him aside, there is only a pack of imbeciles in
Plassans.'</p>

<p>'Then it is a present you are making to the government?'
said Félicité, with a laugh.</p>

<p>She allowed herself to be convinced. The next day the
name of Delangre was in everybody's mouth. His friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
declared that it was only after the strongest pressure had
been brought to bear upon him that he had accepted the
nomination. He had refused it for a long time, considering
himself unworthy of the position, insisting that he was not a
politician, and that the Marquis de Lagrifoul and Monsieur de
Bourdeu had, on the other hand, had long experience of public
affairs. Then, when it had been impressed upon him that
what Plassans urgently needed was a representative who was
unconnected with the political parties, he had allowed himself
to be prevailed upon. He explicitly declared the principles
upon which he should act if he were returned. It
must be thoroughly understood, he said, that he would not go
to the Chamber either to oppose or support the government
under all circumstances; he should look upon himself solely
as the representative of the interests of the town; he would
always vote for liberty with order, and order with liberty, and
would still remain mayor of Plassans, so that he might show
what a conciliatory and purely administrative task he had
charged himself with. These views struck people as being
singularly sensible. The knowing politicians of the Commercial
Club vied with each other that same evening in
lauding Delangre.</p>

<p>'I told you so; he is the very man we want. I shall be
curious to see what the sub-prefect will say when the mayor's
name heads the list. The authorities can scarcely accuse us
of having voted like a lot of sulking school-boys, any more
than they can reproach us with having gone down on our
knees before the government. If the Empire could only
receive a few lessons like this, things would go much better.'</p>

<p>The whole thing was like a train of gunpowder. The
mine was laid, and a spark was sufficient to set it off. In
every part of Plassans simultaneously, in all the three quarters
of the town, in every house, and in every family, Monsieur
Delangre's name was pronounced amidst unanimous
eulogies. He had become the expected Messiah, the saviour,
unknown the previous day, revealed in the morning, and
worshipped ere night.</p>

<p>Even in the sacristies and confessionals of Plassans, his
name was buzzed about; it mingled with the echoes in the
naves, sounded from pulpits in the suburbs, was passed on
from ear to ear like a sacrament, and made its way into the
most distant homes of the pious. The priests carried it about
with them in the folds of their cassocks; Abbé Bourrette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
bestowed on it the respectable cheeriness of his corporation,
Abbé Surin the grace of his smile, and Monseigneur
Rousselot the charm of his pastoral blessing. The fashionable
ladies were never tired of talking of Monsieur Delangre.
He had such a kind disposition, they said, and such a fine
sensible face. Madame Rastoil learned to blush again at
mention of him; Madame Paloque grew almost pretty in
her enthusiasm, while as for Madame de Condamin, she
was ready to fight for him, and won all hearts to his side
by the tender way in which she pressed the hands of the
electors who promised to vote for him. The Young Men's
Club, too, grew passionately enthusiastic on his behalf.
Séverin made quite a hero of him, and Guillaume and the
young Maffres went canvassing for him through all the disreputable
parts of the town.</p>

<p>On the day of the election his majority was overwhelming.
The whole town seemed to have conspired together to return
him. The Marquis de Lagrifoul and Monsieur de Bourdeu,
bursting with indignation and crying that they had been
betrayed, had retired from the contest, and thus Monsieur
Delangre's only opponent was the hatter Maurin. The latter
received the votes of some fifteen hundred intractable Republicans
of the outskirts of the town; while the mayor had the
support of the country districts, the fervent Bonapartists, the
townsmen of the new quarter who were amenable to clerical
influence, the timid shopkeepers of the old town, and even
certain simple-minded Royalists of the district of Saint-Marc,
whose aristocratic denizens chiefly abstained from voting.
Monsieur Delangre thus obtained thirty-three thousand votes.
The business was managed so promptly, the victory was won
with such a dash, that Plassans felt quite amazed, on the
evening of the election, to find itself so unanimous. The
town half fancied that it had just had a wonderful dream,
that some powerful hand must have struck the soil and
drawn from it those thirty-three thousand electors, that army,
almost alarming in its numbers, whose strength no one had
ever before suspected. The politicians of the Commercial
Club looked at one another in perplexity, like men dazed with
victory.</p>

<p>In the evening, Monsieur Rastoil's friends joined those of
Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies, to congratulate each other, in
a little drawing-room at the Sub-Prefecture, overlooking the
gardens. Tea was served to them. The great victory of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
day ended by a coalition of the two parties. All the usual
guests were present.</p>

<p>'I have never systematically opposed any government,'
said Monsieur Rastoil, after a time, as he accepted some little
cakes which Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies offered him.
'The judicial bench ought to take no part in political
struggles. I willingly admit that the Empire has already
accomplished some great things, and that it has a still nobler
future before it, if it continues to advance in the paths of
justice and liberty.'</p>

<p>The sub-prefect bowed, as though this eulogy was addressed
to himself personally. The previous evening, Monsieur Rastoil
had read in the 'Moniteur' a decree appointing his son assistant
public prosecutor at Faverolles. There was also a good
deal of talk about a marriage between his eldest daughter and
Lucien Delangre.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes! it is quite settled,' Monsieur de Condamin said
in low tones to Madame Paloque, who had just been questioning
him upon the subject. 'He has chosen Angéline. I
believe that he would rather have had Aurélie, but it has
probably been hinted to him that it would not be seemly for
the younger sister to be married before the elder one.'</p>

<p>'Angéline! Are you quite sure?' Madame Paloque murmured
maliciously. 'I fancy that Angéline has a likeness&mdash;'</p>

<p>The conservator of rivers and forests put his finger to his
lips, with a smile.</p>

<p>'Well, it's just a toss-up, isn't it?' she continued. 'It
will strengthen the ties between the two families. We are all
good friends now. Paloque is expecting his cross, and I am
quite satisfied with everything.'</p>

<p>Monsieur Delangre did not arrive till late. He received,
as newspaper writers say, a perfect ovation. Madame de
Condamin had just informed Doctor Porquier that his son
Guillaume had been nominated chief clerk at the post-office.
She was circulating good news through the room, declaring
that Abbé Bourrette would be vicar-general the following
year; that Abbé Surin would be a bishop before he was forty,
and that Monsieur Maffre was to have a cross.</p>

<p>'Poor Bourdeu!' exclaimed Monsieur Rastoil, with a last
sigh of regret.</p>

<p>'Oh, there's no occasion to pity him!' cried Madame de
Condamin, gaily. 'I will undertake to console him. He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
not cut out for the Chamber. What he wants is a prefecture.
Tell him that he shall have one before long.'</p>

<p>The merriment increased. The fair Octavie's high spirits,
and the desire which she showed to please everybody, delighted
the company. It was really she who was doing the honours
of the Sub-Prefecture. She was the queen of the place. And,
while she seemed to be speaking quite playfully, she gave
Monsieur Delangre the most practical advice in the world
about the part he ought to play in the Corps Législatif. She
took him aside and offered to introduce him to several
influential people, an offer which he gratefully accepted.
About eleven o'clock, Monsieur de Condamin suggested that
the garden should be illuminated, but his wife calmed the
enthusiasm of the gentlemen, and said that such a course
would be inadvisable, for it would not do to appear to be
exulting over the town.</p>

<p>'Well, what about Abbé Fenil?' she suddenly asked
Abbé Faujas, as she took him aside into one of the window
recesses. 'He has not made any movement, has he?'</p>

<p>'Abbé Fenil is a man of sense,' the priest replied. 'It has
been hinted to him that he would do well not to interfere in
political matters for the future.'</p>

<p>In the midst of all the triumphant joy, Abbé Faujas
remained grave. He had won after a hard fight. Madame
de Condamin's chatter wearied him; and the satisfaction of
these people, with their poor vulgar ambitions, filled him with
disdain. As he stood leaning against the mantelpiece, with
a far-off look in his eyes, he seemed to be buried in thought.
He was master now, and no longer compelled to veil and
suppress his real feelings. He could reach out his hand and
seize the town, and make it tremble in his grasp. His tall,
black figure seemed to fill the room. The guests gradually
drew their chairs closer to him, and formed a circle round him.
The men awaited some expression of satisfaction from his lips,
the women besought him with their eyes, like submissive
slaves. But he bluntly broke through the circle and went
away the first, saying but a brief word or two as he took his
leave.</p>

<p>When he returned to the Mourets' house, going thither by
way of the Impasse des Chevillottes and the garden, he found
Marthe alone in the dining-room, sitting listlessly on a chair
against the wall, looking very pale, and gazing with a blank
expression at the lamp, the wick of which was beginning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
char. Upstairs, Trouche was having a party, and could be
heard singing a broad comic song, which Olympe and his
guests accompanied by striking their glasses with the handles
of their knives.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="XX" id="XX">XX</a></h3>


<p>Abbé Faujas laid his hand on Marthe's shoulder. 'What
are you doing here?' he asked. 'Why haven't you gone to
bed? I told you that you were not to wait for me.'</p>

<p>She started up and stammered:</p>

<p>'I thought you would be back much earlier than this. I
fell asleep. I dare say Rose will have got some tea ready.'</p>

<p>The priest called for the cook and rated her for not having
made her mistress go to bed. He spoke in authoritative tones
that admitted of no reply.</p>

<p>'Bring the tea for his reverence, Rose,' said Marthe.</p>

<p>'No, I don't want any tea,' the priest said with a show
of vexation. 'Go to bed immediately. It is absurd. I can
scarcely control myself. Show me a light, Rose.'</p>

<p>The cook went with him as far as the foot of the staircase.</p>

<p>'Your reverence knows that I am not to blame,' she said.
'Madame is very strange. Ill as she is, she can't stop for a
single hour in her room. She can't keep from coming and
going up and down, and fidgetting about merely for the sake
of being on the move. She puts me out quite as much as
anyone else; she is always in my way, preventing me from
getting on with anything. Then she drops down on a chair
and sits staring in front of her with a terrified look, as though
she could see something horrible. I told her half a score of
times at least, to-night, that you would be very angry with
her for not going to bed; but she didn't even seem to hear
what I said.'</p>

<p>The priest went upstairs without replying. As he passed
the Trouches' room he stretched out his arm as though he
was going to bang his fist on the door. But the singing had
stopped, and he could tell from the sounds within that the
visitors were about to take their departure, so he quickly
stepped into his own room. Almost immediately afterwards
Trouche went downstairs with a couple of men whom he had
picked up in some low café, crying out on the staircase that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
he knew how to behave himself and was going to see them
home. Olympe leant over the banisters.</p>

<p>'You can fasten the doors,' she said to Rose. 'He won't
be back before to-morrow morning.'</p>

<p>Rose, from whom she had not been able to conceal her
husband's misconduct, expressed much pity for her, and
growled as she fastened the doors:</p>

<p>'What fools women are to get married! Their husbands
either beat them or go off after hussies. For my part, I'd very
much rather keep as I am.'</p>

<p>When she went back into the dining-room she found her
mistress again in a sort of melancholy stupor, with her eyes
fixed upon the lamp. She shook her and made her go upstairs
to bed. Marthe had become very timid. She said she saw
great patches of light on the walls of her room at night-time,
and heard violent blows at the head of her bed. Rose now
slept near her, in a little dressing-room whence she hastened
to calm her at the slightest uneasiness. That night she had
not finished undressing herself before she heard Marthe
groaning, and, on rushing into her room, she found her lying
amidst the disordered bed-clothes, her eyes staring widely in
mute horror, and her clenched fists pressed closely against her
mouth to keep herself from shrieking. Rose was obliged to
talk to her and soothe her as though she were a mere child,
and even had to look behind the curtains and under the
furniture, and assure her that she was mistaken, for there
was really no one there. These attacks of terror ended in
cataleptic seizures, when the unhappy woman lay back on her
pillow, with her eyelids rigidly opened as though she were dead.</p>

<p>'It is the thought of the master that torments her,' Rose
muttered, as she at last got into bed.</p>

<p>The next day was one of those when Doctor Porquier
called. He came regularly twice a week to see Madame
Mouret. He patted her hands and said to her with his
amiable optimism:</p>

<p>'Oh! nothing serious will come of this, my dear lady.
You still cough a little, don't you? Ah! it's a mere cold
which has been neglected, but which we will cure with some
syrups.'</p>

<p>But Marthe complained to him of intolerable pains in her
back and chest, and kept her eyes upon him, as if trying to
discover from his face and manner what he would not say in
words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>'I am afraid of going mad!' she suddenly cried, breaking
into a sob.</p>

<p>The doctor smilingly reassured her. The sight of him
always caused her keen anxiety, she felt a sort of alarm of
this gentle and agreeable man. She often told Rose not to
admit him, saying that she was not ill, and had no need to
have a doctor constantly to see her. Rose shrugged her
shoulders, however, and ushered the doctor into the room.
However, he had almost ceased speaking to Marthe about
her ailments, and seemed to be merely making friendly calls
upon her.</p>

<p>As he was going away, he met Abbé Faujas, who was
returning from Saint-Saturnin's. The priest questioned him
respecting Madame Mouret's condition.</p>

<p>'Science is sometimes quite powerless,' said the doctor
gravely, 'but the goodness of Providence is inexhaustible.
The poor lady has been sorely shaken, but I don't altogether
give her up. Her chest is only slightly attacked as yet, and
the climate here is favourable.'</p>

<p>Then he started a dissertation upon the treatment of pulmonary
diseases in the neighbourhood of Plassans. He was
preparing a pamphlet on the subject, not for publication, for
he was too shrewd to wish to seem a <i>savant</i>, but for the
perusal of a few intimate friends.</p>

<p>'I have weighty reasons,' he said in conclusion, 'for
believing that the equable temperature, the aromatic flora,
and the salubrious springs of our hills, are extremely effective
for the cure of pulmonary complaints.'</p>

<p>The priest had listened to him with his usual stern expression.</p>

<p>'You are mistaken,' he said slowly, 'Plassans does not
agree with Madame Mouret. Why not send her to pass the
winter at Nice?'</p>

<p>'At Nice?' repeated the doctor, uneasily.</p>

<p>He looked at the priest for a moment, and then continued
in his complacent way:</p>

<p>'Nice certainly would be very suitable for her. In her
present condition of nervous excitement, a change of surroundings
would probably have very beneficial results. I must
advise her to make the journey. It is an excellent idea of
yours, Monsieur le Curé.'</p>

<p>He bowed, parted from the Abbé, and made his way to
Madame de Condamin, whose slightest headaches caused him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
endless trouble and anxiety. At dinner, the next day, Marthe
spoke of the doctor in almost violent terms. She swore that
she would never allow him to visit her again.</p>

<p>'It is he who is making me ill,' she exclaimed. 'This
very afternoon he has been advising me to go off on a
journey.'</p>

<p>'And I entirely agree with him in that,' declared Abbé
Faujas, folding his napkin.</p>

<p>She fixed her eyes upon him, and turned very pale as she
murmured in a low voice:</p>

<p>'What! Do you also want to send me away from
Plassans? Oh! I should die in a strange land far away from
all my old associations, and far away from those I love.'</p>

<p>The priest had risen from his seat, and was about to leave
the dining-room. He stepped towards her, and said with a
smile:</p>

<p>'Your friends only think of what is good for your health.
Why are you so rebellious?'</p>

<p>'Oh! I don't want to go! I don't want to go!' she cried,
stepping back from him.</p>

<p>There was a short contest between them. The blood
rushed to the Abbé's cheeks, and he crossed his arms, as
though to withstand a temptation to strike Marthe. She
was leaning against the wall, in despair at her weakness.
Then, quite vanquished, she stretched out her hands, and
stammered:</p>

<p>'I beseech you to allow me to remain here. I will do
whatever you tell me.'</p>

<p>Then, as she burst into sobs, the Abbé shrugged his
shoulders and left the room, like a husband fearing an outbreak
of tears. Madame Faujas, who was tranquilly finishing
her dinner, had witnessed the scene and continued eating.
She let Marthe cry on undisturbed.</p>

<p>'You are extremely unreasonable, my dear child,' she said
after a time, helping herself to some more sweetmeats. 'You
will end by making Ovide quite detest you. You don't know
how to treat him. Why do you refuse to go away from home,
if it is necessary for your health? We should look after the
house for you, and you would find everything all right and in
its place when you came back.'</p>

<p>Marthe was still sobbing, and did not seem to hear what
Madame Faujas said.</p>

<p>'Ovide has so much to think about,' the old lady continued.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
'Do you know that he often works till four o'clock
in the morning? When you cough all through the night, it
disturbs him very much, and distracts his thoughts. He can't
work any longer, and he suffers more than you do. Do this
for Ovide's sake, my dear child; go away, and come back to
us in good health.'</p>

<p>Then Marthe raised her face, red with weeping, and
throwing all her anguish into one cry, she wailed: 'Oh!
Heaven lies!'</p>

<p>During the next few days no further pressure was brought
to bear upon Madame Mouret to induce her to make the
journey to Nice. She grew terribly excited at the least
reference to it. She refused to leave Plassans with such a
show of determination that the priest himself recognised the
danger of insisting upon the scheme. In the midst of his
triumph she was beginning to cause him terrible anxiety and
embarrassment. Trouche declared, with his snigger, that it
was she who ought to have been sent the first to Les Tulettes.
Ever since Mouret had been taken off, she had secluded herself
in the practice of the most rigid religious practices, and
refrained from ever mentioning her husband's name, praying
indeed that she might be rendered altogether oblivious of the
past. But she still remained restless, and returned from Saint-Saturnin's
with even a keener longing for forgetfulness than
she had had when she went thither.</p>

<p>'Our landlady is going it finely,' Olympe said to her
husband when she came home one evening. 'I went with
her to church to-day, and I had to pick her up from the flag-stones.
You would laugh if I told you all the things that she
vomited out against Ovide. She is quite furious with him;
she says that he has no heart, and that he has deceived her
in promising her a heap of consolations. And you should
hear her rail, too, against the Divinity. Ah! it's only your
pious people who talk so badly of religion! Anyone would
think, to hear her, that God had cheated her of a large sum
of money. Do you know, I really believe that her husband
comes and haunts her at night.'</p>

<p>Trouche was much amused by this gossip.</p>

<p>'Well, she has herself to blame for that,' he said. 'If
that old joker Mouret was put away, it was her own doing.
If I were Faujas, I should know how to arrange matters, and
I would make her as gentle and content as a sheep. But
Faujas is an ass, and you will see that he will make a mess of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
the business. Your brother, my dear, hasn't shown himself
sufficiently pleasant to us for me to help him out of the
bother. I shall have a rare laugh the day our landlady
makes him take the plunge.'</p>

<p>'Ovide certainly looks down upon women too much,' declared
Olympe.</p>

<p>Then Trouche continued in a lower tone:</p>

<p>'I say, you know, if our landlady were to throw herself
down some well with your noodle of a brother, we should be
the masters, and the house would be ours. We should be
able to feather our nest nicely then. It would be a splendid
ending to it all, that!'</p>

<p>Since Mouret's departure, the Trouches also had invaded
the ground-floor of the house. Olympe had begun by complaining
that the chimneys upstairs smoked, and she had
ended by persuading Marthe that the drawing-room, which
had hitherto been unoccupied, was the healthiest room in the
house. Rose was ordered to light a big fire there, and the
two women spent their days in endless talk, before the
huge blazing logs. It was one of Olympe's dreams to be able
to live like this, handsomely dressed and lolling on a couch
in the midst of an elegantly furnished room. She even persuaded
Marthe to have the drawing-room re-papered, to buy
some new furniture and a fresh carpet for it. Then she felt
that she was a lady. She came downstairs in her slippers
and dressing-gown, and talked as though she were the mistress
of the house.</p>

<p>'That poor Madame Mouret,' she would say, 'has so much
worry that she has asked me to help her, and so I devote a
little of my time to assisting her. It is really a kindness to
do so.'</p>

<p>She had, indeed, quite succeeded in winning the confidence
of Marthe, who, from sheer lassitude, handed over to her the
petty details of the household management. It was Olympe
who kept the keys of the cellar and the cupboards, and paid
the tradesmen's bills as well. She had been deliberating for
a long time as to how she should manage to make herself
equally free in the dining-room. Trouche, however, dissuaded
her from attempting to carry out that design. They would
no longer be able to eat and drink as they liked, he said; they
would not even dare to drink their wine unwatered, or to ask
a friend to come and have coffee. Then Olympe declared
that at any rate she would bring their share of the dessert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
upstairs. She crammed her pockets with sugar, and she even
carried off candle-ends. For this purpose, she made some
big canvas pockets, which she fastened under her skirt, and
which it took her a good quarter of an hour to empty every
evening.</p>

<p>'There! there's something for a rainy day,' she said, as
she bundled a stock of provisions into a box, which she then
pushed under the bed. 'If we happen to fall out with our
landlady, we shall have something to keep us going for a
time. I must bring up some pots of preserves and some salt
pork.'</p>

<p>'There is no need to make a secret of it,' said Trouche.
'If I were you, I should make Rose bring them up, as you are
the mistress.'</p>

<p>Trouche had made himself master of the garden. For a
long time past he had envied Mouret as he had watched him
pruning his trees, gravelling his walks, and watering his
lettuces; and he had indulged in a dream of one day having
a plot of ground of his own, where he might dig and plant as
he liked. So, now that Mouret was no longer there, he took
possession of the garden, planning all kinds of alterations in it.
He began by condemning the vegetables. He had a delicate
soul, he said, and he loved flowers. But the labour of
digging tired him out on the second day, and a gardener was
called in, who dug up the beds under his directions, threw
the vegetables on to the dung-heap, and prepared the soil for
the reception of pæonies, roses and lilies, larkspurs and convolvuli,
and cuttings of geraniums and carnations. Then
an idea occurred to Trouche. It struck him that the tall
sombre box plants, which bordered the beds, had a mournful
appearance, and he meditated for a long time about pulling
them up.</p>

<p>'You are quite right,' said Olympe, whom he consulted on
the matter. 'They make the place look like a cemetery. For
my part, I should much prefer an edging of cast-iron made to
resemble rough wood. I will persuade the landlady to have
it done. Anyhow, pull up the box.'</p>

<p>The box was accordingly pulled up. A week later the
gardener came and laid down the cast-iron edging. Trouche
also removed several fruit-trees which interfered with the
view, had the arbour painted afresh a bright green, and ornamented
the fountain with rock-work. Monsieur Rastoil's
cascade greatly excited his envy, but he contented himself for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
the time by choosing a place where he would construct a
similar one, 'if everything should go on all right.'</p>

<p>'This will make our neighbours open their eyes,' he said
in the evening to his wife. 'They will see that there is a
man of taste here now. In the summer, when we sit at the
window, we shall have a delightful view, and the garden will
smell deliciously.'</p>

<p>Marthe let him have his own way and gave her consent to
all the plans that were submitted to her, and in the end he
gave over even consulting her. It was solely Madame Faujas
that the Trouches had to contend against, and she continued
to dispute possession of the house with them very obstinately.
It was only after a battle royal with her mother that Olympe
had been able to take possession of the drawing-room.
Madame Faujas had all but won the day on that occasion.
It was the priest's fault if she had not proved victorious.</p>

<p>'That hussy of a sister of yours says everything that is
bad of us to the landlady,' Madame Faujas perpetually
complained. 'I can see through her game. She wants to
supplant us and to get everything for herself. She is trying
to settle herself down in the drawing-room like a fine lady,
the slut!'</p>

<p>The priest however paid no attention to what his mother
said; he only broke out into sharp gestures of impatience at
her complaints. One day he got quite angry and exclaimed:</p>

<p>'I beg of you, mother, do leave me in peace. Don't talk
to me any more about Olympe or Trouche. Let them go and
hang themselves, if they like.'</p>

<p>'But they are seizing the whole house, Ovide. They are
perfect rats. When you want your share, you will find that
they have gnawed it all away. You are the only one who can
keep them in check.'</p>

<p>He looked at his mother with a faint smile.</p>

<p>'You love me very much, mother,' said he, 'and I forgive
you. Make your mind easy; I want something very different
from the house. It isn't mine, and I only keep what I
gain. You will be very proud when you see my share.
Trouche has been useful to me, and we must shut our eyes a
little.'</p>

<p>Madame Faujas was then obliged to beat a retreat; but
she did so with very bad grace. The absolute disinterestedness
of her son made her, with her material baser desires and
careful economical nature, quite desperate. She would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
liked to lock the house up so that Ovide might find it ready
in perfect order for his occupation whenever he might want
it. The Trouches, with their grasping ways, caused her all
the torment and despair felt by a miser who is being preyed
upon by strangers. It was exactly as though they were
wasting her own substance, fattening upon her own flesh,
and reducing herself and her beloved son to penury and
wretchedness. When the Abbé forbade her to oppose the
gradual invasion of the Trouches, she made up her mind that
she would at any rate save all she could from the hands of
the spoilers, and so she began pilfering from the cupboards,
just as Olympe did. She also fastened big pockets underneath
her skirts, and had a chest which she filled with all the things
she collected together&mdash;provisions, linen, and miscellaneous
articles.</p>

<p>'What is that you are stowing away there, mother?' the
Abbé asked one evening as he went into her room, attracted
by the noise which she made in moving the chest.</p>

<p>She began to stammer out a reply, but the priest understood
it all at a glance, and flew into a violent rage.</p>

<p>'It is too shameful!' he said. 'You have turned yourself
into a thief, now! What would the consequences be if
you were to be detected? I should be the talk of the whole
town!'</p>

<p>'It is all for your sake, Ovide,' she murmured.</p>

<p>'A thief! My mother a thief! Perhaps you think that
I thieve, too, that I have come here to plunder, and that my
only ambition is to lay my hands upon whatever I can!
Good heavens! what sort of an opinion have you formed of
me? We shall have to separate, mother, if we do not understand
each other better than this.'</p>

<p>This speech quite crushed the old woman. She had remained
on her knees in front of the chest, and she sank into
a crouching position upon the floor, very pale and almost
choking, and stretching out her hands beseechingly. When
she was able to speak, she wailed out:</p>

<p>'It is for your benefit, my child, for yours only, I swear.
I have told you before that they are taking everything; your
sister crams everything into her pockets. There will be nothing
left for you, not even a lump of sugar. But I won't
take anything more, since it makes you angry, and you will
let me stay with you, won't you? You will keep me with you,
won't you?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>Abbé Faujas refused to make any promises until she had
restored everything she had taken to its place. For nearly
a week he himself superintended the secret restoration of the
contents of the chest. He watched his mother fill her pockets,
and waited till she came back upstairs again to take a fresh
load. For prudential reasons he allowed her to make only
two journeys backwards and forwards every evening. The old
woman felt as though her heart was breaking as she restored
each article to its former place. She did not dare to cry, but
her eyelids were swollen with tears of regret, and her hands
trembled even more than they had done when they were
ransacking the cupboards. However, what afflicted her more
than anything else was to see that as soon as she had restored
each article to its rightful position, Olympe followed
in her wake and took possession of it. The linen, the provisions,
and the candle-ends, merely passed from one pocket
to another.</p>

<p>'I won't take anything more downstairs,' she exclaimed to
her son, growing rebellious at this unforeseen result of her
restorations. 'It isn't the least good, for your sister only
walks off with everything directly I put it back. The hussy!
I might just as well give her the chest at once! She must
have got a nice little hoard together! I beseech you, Ovide,
let me keep what still remains. Our landlady will be none
the worse off for it, because she will lose it anyhow.'</p>

<p>'My sister is what she is,' the priest replied tranquilly;
'but I wish my mother to be an honest woman. You will
help me much more by not committing such actions.'</p>

<p>She was forced to restore everything, and from that time
forward she harboured fierce hatred against the Trouches,
Marthe, and the whole establishment. She often said that the
day would come when she should have to defend Ovide against
everybody.</p>

<p>The Trouches were now reigning in all sovereignty. They
completed the conquest of the house, and made their way
into every corner of it. The Abbé's own rooms were the
only ones they respected. It was only before him that they
trembled. But even his presence in the house did not
prevent them from inviting their friends, and indulging
in debauches till two o'clock in the morning. Guillaume
Porquier came with parties of mere youths. Olympe, notwithstanding
her thirty-seven years, then simpered and put
on girlish airs; and flirted with more than one of the college<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
lads. The house was becoming a perfect paradise to her.
Trouche sniggered and joked about it when they were alone
together.</p>

<p>'Well,' she said, quite tranquilly, 'you do as you like,
don't you? We are both free to do as we please, you know.'</p>

<p>Trouche had, as a matter of fact, all but brought his pleasant
life to an abrupt conclusion. There had been an unpleasant
affair at the Home of the Virgin in connection with one of
the girls there. One of the Sisters of St. Joseph had complained
of Trouche to Abbé Faujas. He had thanked her
for telling him, and had impressed upon her that the cause of
religion would suffer by such a scandal. So the affair was
hushed up, and the lady patronesses never had the faintest
suspicion of it. Abbé Faujas, however, had a terrible scene
with his brother-in-law, whom he assailed in Olympe's
presence, so that his wife might have a weapon against him,
and be able to keep him in check.</p>

<p>The Trouches had been troubled for a long time past by
another matter. Notwithstanding their life of clover, although
they were provided with so many things out of Marthe's
cupboards, they had got terribly into debt in the neighbourhood.
Trouche squandered his salary away in cafés, and
Olympe wasted the money which she drew out of Marthe's
pockets by indulging in all sorts of silly fancies. As for the
necessaries of life, they made a point of getting these upon credit.
There was one account which made them particularly uneasy,
that of a pastrycook in the Rue de la Banne, which amounted
to more than a hundred francs, for the pastrycook was a
rough, blunt sort of man, who had threatened to lay the
whole matter before Abbé Faujas. The Trouches thus long
lived in a state of alarm, but when the bill was actually
presented to him Abbé Faujas paid it without a word, and
even forgot to address any reproaches to them on the subject.
The priest seemed to be above all those sordid little matters,
and went on living a gloomy and rigid life in this house that
was given up to pillage, without appearing conscious of the
gradual ruin which was falling upon it. Everything, indeed,
was crumbling away around him, while he continued to
advance straight towards the goal of his ambition. He still
camped like a soldier in his big bare room, indulging in no
comforts, and showing annoyance when any were pressed
upon him. Since he had become the master of Plassans, he
had dropped back into complete carelessness as to his appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
His hat became rusty, his stockings muddy; his
cassock, which his mother mended every morning, looked just
like the pitiful, worn-out rag which he had worn when he
first came to Plassans.</p>

<p>'Pooh! it is very good yet,' he used to say, when anyone
hazarded a timid remark about it.</p>

<p>He made a display of it, walked about the streets in it,
carrying his head loftily, and altogether unheeding the curious
glances which were cast at him. There was no bravado in
the matter; he was simply following his natural inclinations.
Now that he believed that he need no longer lay himself out
to please, he fell back into all his old disdain for mere appearance.
It was his triumph to sit down just as he was, with
his tall, clumsy body, rough, blunt manner and torn clothes,
in the midst of conquered Plassans.</p>

<p>Madame de Condamin, distressed by the strong smell
which emanated from his cassock, one day gently took him to
task about his appearance.</p>

<p>'Do you know,' she said to him, laughing, 'that the
ladies are beginning to detest you? They say that you now
never take the least trouble over your toilet. Once upon a
time, when you took your handkerchief out of your pocket,
it was just as though there were a choir-boy swinging a
thurible behind you.'</p>

<p>The priest looked greatly astonished. He was quite
unaware of any change in himself. Then Madame de
Condamin, drawing a little nearer to him, said in a friendly
tone:</p>

<p>'Will you let me speak quite frankly to you, my dear Curé?
It is really a mistake on your part to be so negligent of your
appearance. You scarcely shave, and you never comb your
hair; it is as rough and tumbled as though you had been
fighting. I can assure you that all this has a very bad effect.
Madame Rastoil and Madame Delangre told me yesterday
that they could scarcely recognise you. You are really compromising
your success.'</p>

<p>The priest gave a laugh of defiance, as he shook his
powerful unkempt head.</p>

<p>'Now that the battle is won,' he merely replied, 'they
must put up with my hair being uncombed.'</p>

<p>Plassans had, indeed, to put up with him with his hair
uncombed. The once seemingly flexible priest was now
transformed into a stern, despotic master who bent all wills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
to his own. His face, which had again become cadaverous in
hue, shone with eyes like an eagle's, and he raised his big
hands as though they were filled with threats and chastisements.
The town was positively terrified on beholding the
master it had imposed upon itself, with his shabby, dirty
clothing and unkempt hair. The covert alarm of the women
only tended, however, to strengthen his power. He was
stern and harsh to his penitents, but not one of them dared
to leave him. They came to him in fear and trembling, in
which they found some touch of painful pleasure.</p>

<p>'I was wrong, my dear,' Madame de Condamin confessed
to Marthe, 'in wanting him to perfume himself. I am growing
accustomed to him, and even prefer him as he is. He is
indeed a man!'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas was supreme at the Bishop's. Since the
elections he had left Monseigneur Rousselot only a show of
authority. The Bishop lived amidst his beloved books in his
study, where the Abbé, who administered the diocese from an
adjoining room, virtually kept him prisoner, only allowing him
to see those persons whom he could fully trust. The clergy
trembled before this absolute master. The old white-headed
priests bent before him with all humility and surrender of
personal will. Monseigneur Rousselot, when he was alone
with Abbé Surin, often wept silent tears. He regretted the
impetuous mastery of Abbé Fenil, who had, at any rate,
intervals of affectionate softness, whereas now, under Abbé
Faujas's rule, he felt a relentless, ceaseless pressure. However,
he would smile again and resign himself, saying with a
sort of pleasant self-satisfaction:</p>

<p>'Come, my child, let us get to work. I must not complain,
for I am now leading the life which I always dreamed
of&mdash;a life of perfect solitude amongst my books.'</p>

<p>Then he sighed, and continued in a lower tone:</p>

<p>'I should be quite happy if I were not afraid of losing you,
my dear Surin. He will end by not tolerating your presence
here any longer. I thought that he looked at you very
suspiciously yesterday. Always agree with him, I beseech
you; take his side and don't spare me. Ah me! I have only
you left now.'</p>

<p>Two months after the elections Abbé Vial, one of the
Bishop's grand-vicars, went to settle at Rome. Abbé Faujas
stepped into his place as a matter of course, although it had
been promised long ago to Abbé Bourrette. He did not even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
promote the latter to the living of Saint-Saturnin's which he
vacated, but preferred to it a young ambitious priest whom he
had made a tool of his own.</p>

<p>'His lordship would not hear of you,' he said curtly to
Abbé Bourrette when he met him.</p>

<p>When the poor old priest stammered out that he would go
and see the Bishop, and ask for an explanation, Abbé Faujas
added more gently:</p>

<p>'His lordship is too unwell to see you. Trust yourself in
my hands; I will plead your cause for you.'</p>

<p>From his first appearance in the Chamber in Paris Monsieur
Delangre had voted with the majority. Plassans was conquered
for the Empire. Abbé Faujas almost seemed actuated by a
feeling of revenge in the rough way in which he treated the
prudent townspeople. He again closed the little doors that
led into the Impasse des Chevillottes, and compelled Monsieur
Rastoil and his friends to enter the Sub-Prefecture by the
official door facing the Place. When he appeared at the sub-prefect's
friendly gatherings, the guests showed themselves
very humble in his presence. So great was the fascination
he exercised, and so great the fear he inspired, that even when
he was not present nobody dared to make the slightest
equivocal remark concerning him.</p>

<p>'He is a man of the greatest merit,' declared Monsieur
Péqueur des Saulaies, who now counted on being promoted to
a prefecture.</p>

<p>'A very remarkable man, indeed,' chimed in Doctor Porquier.
All the company nodded their heads approvingly till
Monsieur de Condamin, who began to feel irritated by this
eulogistic unanimity, amused himself by putting them into
embarrassment.</p>

<p>'Well, he hasn't a pleasant temper, anyway,' said he.</p>

<p>This remark had a chilling effect upon the company. Each
was afraid that his neighbour might be in the terrible Abbé's
pay.</p>

<p>'The grand-vicar has an excellent heart,' Monsieur Rastoil
prudently remarked; 'but, like all great minds, he appears at
first sight to be a little stern.'</p>

<p>'It is just so with me; I am very easy to get on with, but
I have always had the reputation of being a hard, stern man,'
exclaimed Monsieur de Bourdeu, who had become reconciled
with the party again after a long private interview which he
had had with Abbé Faujas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, wishing to put everyone at ease again, the presiding
judge exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Have you heard that there is a probability of a bishopric
for the grand-vicar?'</p>

<p>At this they brightened up. Monsieur Maffre expressed
the opinion that it would be of Plassans itself that Abbé
Faujas would become bishop, after the retirement of Monseigneur
Rousselot, whose health was very feeble.</p>

<p>'Everyone would gain by it,' said Abbé Bourrette guilelessly.
'Illness has embittered his lordship; I know that our
excellent Faujas has made the greatest efforts to persuade
him out of certain unjust prejudices which he entertains.'</p>

<p>'He is very fond of you,' asserted Judge Paloque, who had
just received his decoration; 'my wife has heard him complain
of the way in which you are neglected.'</p>

<p>When Abbé Surin was present, he, too, joined in the
general chorus; but, although he had a mitre in his pocket,
to use the expression of the priests of the diocese, the success
of Abbé Faujas made him uneasy. He looked at him in his
pretty way, and, calling to mind the Bishop's prediction, tried
to discover the weak point which would bring that colossus
toppling in the dust.</p>

<p>The gentlemen of the party, it should be said, had had
their desires satisfied; that is, excepting Monsieur de Bourdeu
and Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies, who were still waiting
for the marks of the government's favour. These two were,
consequently, the warmest partisans of Abbé Faujas. The
others, to tell the truth, would have been glad to rebel, if they
had dared. They were growing secretly weary of the continual
gratitude which was exacted from them by their
master, and they ardently wished that some strong, bold hand
would effect their deliverance. One day Madame Paloque,
with an affectation of indifference inquired:</p>

<p>'What has become of Abbé Fenil? I haven't seen or
heard of him for an age.'</p>

<p>There was profound silence. Monsieur de Condamin was
the only one present capable of venturing upon such dangerous
ground. They all looked at him.</p>

<p>'Oh!' he said quietly, 'I believe he shuts himself up at
his place at Les Tulettes.'</p>

<p>Madame de Condamin added with an ironical smile:</p>

<p>'He can sleep quietly now. His career is over; he will
take no part again in the affairs of Plassans.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>There was only Marthe who remained a real obstacle in
Abbé Faujas's path. He felt that she was escaping him
more and more each day. He stiffened his will and called up
all his forces as priest and man to bend her, without succeeding
in moderating the flame which he had fanned into life.
She was striving to reach the logical end of her passionate
longings, and insisted upon forcing her way further and
further into the peace and ecstasy and perfect self-forgetfulness
of divine happiness. It was bitter pain and anguish to
her to be, as it were, walled in and prevented from reaching
that threshold of light, of which she fancied she caught a
glimpse, though it seemed to be ever receding from her reach.
She shivered and trembled now at Saint-Saturnin's in the
coldness and the gloom amidst which she had once felt such
thrills of delight. The peals of the organ no longer stirred
her with a tremor of voluptuous joy; the white clouds of
incense no longer lulled her into sweet mystic dreams;
the gleaming chapels and the sacred pyxes that flashed like
stars, the chasubles with their sheen of gold and silver, all
now seemed pale and wan to her eyes that were dull and dim
with tears. Like a damned soul yearning after Paradise,
she threw up her arms in bitter desperation and besought
the love that denied itself to her, sobbing and wailing:</p>

<p>'My God, my God! why hast Thou forsaken me?'</p>

<p>Bowed down with shame, hurt, as it were, by the cold
silence of the vaulted roof, Marthe left the church, burning
with the anger of a scorned woman. She had wild dreams of
pouring out her blood, and she writhed madly at her impotence
to do more than to pray, at being unable to spring at a single
bound into the arms of God. And when she returned home,
she felt that her only hope was in Abbé Faujas. It was he
alone that could make her God's. He had revealed to her
the initiatory joys; he must now tear aside the whole veil.
But the priest fell into a passion with her and treated her
roughly, refusing to hear her so long as she was not on her
knees before him, humble and unresisting like a corpse. She
listened to him, standing upright, sustained by an impulse of
revolt that thrilled her whole being, as she vented upon him
the bitterness that came of her deceived yearnings, and accused
him of the base treachery which was torturing her.</p>

<p>Old Madame Rougon often thought it was her duty to
intervene between the Abbé and her daughter, as she had
formerly done between the latter and Mouret. Marthe having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
told her of her troubles, she spoke to the priest like a mother-in-law
desiring the happiness of her children and doing her
best to restore peace in their home.</p>

<p>'Well,' she said to him with a smile, 'can't you manage
to live in peace? Marthe is constantly complaining and you
seem to be perpetually grieving her. I know very well that
women are exacting, but you must confess that you are a
little wanting in consideration. I am extremely distressed by
what occurs; it would be so easy for you to arrange matters
pleasantly! Do, I beg of you, my dear Abbé, be a little more
gentle with her.'</p>

<p>She also scolded him in a friendly fashion for his slovenly
appearance. She could see, with her shrewd feminine intelligence,
that he was abusing his victory. Then she began to
make excuses for her daughter. The dear child, she said,
had suffered a great deal, and her nervous sensitiveness
required most careful treatment; but she had an excellent
disposition and an affectionate nature which a clever man
might mould after his own wishes. One day, however, when
she was thus showing him how he might make Marthe what
he liked, Abbé Faujas grew weary of her perpetual advice.</p>

<p>'No, no!' he cried, 'your daughter is mad; she bores me
to death. I won't have anything more to do with her. I
would pay the fellow well who would free me of her.'</p>

<p>Madame Rougon looked him keenly in the face and tightly
pressed her lips.</p>

<p>'Listen to me, my friend,' she said after a short silence;
'you are wanting in tact, and that will prove your ruin.
Overthrow yourself, if you like; I wash my hands of you.
I assisted you, not for your own sake, but to please our friends
in Paris. They wrote to me and asked me to pilot you, and
I did so. But understand this, I will never allow you to come
the master over me. It's all very well for little Péqueur, and
simple Rastoil, but we are not at all afraid of you, and we
mean to remain the masters. My husband conquered Plassans
before you did, and I warn you that we shall keep our conquest.'</p>

<p>From that day forward there was great coldness between
the Rougons and Abbé Faujas. When Marthe again came
to complain to her mother, the latter said to her very plainly:</p>

<p>'Your Abbé is only making a fool of you. If I were in
your place I shouldn't hesitate to tell him a few plain truths.
To begin with, he has been disgustingly dirty for a long time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
past, and I can't understand how you can bear to take your
meals at the same table with him.'</p>

<p>Madame Rougon had, in truth, hinted at a very ingenious
plan to her husband, by which the Abbé should be ousted,
and they themselves should reap the reward of his success.
Now that the town voted properly, Rougon, who had not
cared to risk the conduct of the campaign, was quite able to
keep it in the proper path. The green drawing-room would
become all the more influential, and Félicité began to await
developments with that crafty patience to which she owed her
fortune.</p>

<p>On the day when her mother told her that the Abbé was
only making a fool of her, Marthe again repaired to Saint-Saturnin's
resolved upon a last supreme appeal. She remained
in the deserted church for two hours, pouring out her soul in
prayer, waiting longingly for the ecstasy that came not, and
torturing herself with her search for consolation. Impulses
of deep humility stretched her prostrate upon the flag-stones,
momentary thrills of rebellion made her start up again with
her teeth clenched, while her whole being, wildly racked and
strained, broke down at not being able to grasp or kiss aught
save the aching void of her own passion. When she rose and
left the church the sky seemed black to her; she was not
conscious of the pavement beneath her feet; the narrow
streets left upon her the impression of some immense lonely
wilderness. She threw her hat and shawl upon the dining-room
table and went straight upstairs to Abbé Faujas's
room.</p>

<p>The Abbé sat buried in thought, at his little table. His
pen had fallen from his fingers. He opened the door, still
full of his thoughts, but when he saw Marthe standing before
him, very pale, and with the light of deep resolution burning
in her eyes, he made a gesture of anger.</p>

<p>'What do you want?' he asked. 'Why have you come
upstairs? Go down again and wait for me, if you have anything
to say to me.'</p>

<p>She pushed him aside and entered the room without
speaking a word.</p>

<p>The priest hesitated for a moment, struggling against the
influence which was prompting him to raise his hand against
her. He remained standing in front of her, without closing
the door that was wide open.</p>

<p>'What do you want?' he repeated. 'I am busy.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Marthe closed the door, and having done so, drew
nearer to the Abbé and said to him:</p>

<p>'I want to speak to you.'</p>

<p>She sat down and looked about the room, at the narrow
bed, the shabby chest of drawers, and at the big black wooden
crucifix, the sight of which, as it stood out conspicuously
on the bare wall, gave her a passing thrill. A freezing
silence seemed to fall from the ceiling. The grate was quite
empty; there was not even a pinch of ashes in it.</p>

<p>'You will take cold,' said the priest in a calmer voice.
'Let us go downstairs, I beg you.'</p>

<p>'No; I want to speak to you,' said Marthe again.</p>

<p>Then, clasping her hands together like a penitent making
her confession, she continued:</p>

<p>'I owe you much. Before you came, I was without a
soul. It was you who willed that I should be saved. It is
through you that I have known the only joys of my life. You
are my saviour and my father. For these last five years I
have only lived through you and for you.'</p>

<p>Her voice broke down and she almost slipped upon her
knees. The priest stopped her with a gesture.</p>

<p>'And now, to-day,' she cried, 'I am suffering and have
need of your help. Listen to me, father. Do not withdraw
from me. You cannot abandon me thus. I tell you that
God does not listen to me any longer. I do not feel His
presence any longer. Have pity upon me, I beseech you.
Advise me, lead me to those divine graces whose first joys you
made me know; teach me what I should do to cure myself,
and ever advance in the love of God.'</p>

<p>'You must pray,' said the priest gravely.</p>

<p>'I have prayed; I have prayed for hours with my head
buried in my hands, trying to lose myself in every word of
adoration, and yet I have not received consolation. I have
not felt the presence of God.'</p>

<p>'You must pray and pray again, pray continually, pray
until God is moved by your prayers and descends to you.'</p>

<p>She looked at him in anguish.</p>

<p>'Then there is nothing but prayer?' she asked. 'You
cannot give me any help?'</p>

<p>'No; none at all,' he replied roughly.</p>

<p>She threw up her trembling hands in a burst of desperation,
her breast heaving with anger. But she restrained
herself, and she stammered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>'Your heaven is fast closed. You have led me on so far
only to crush me against a wall. I was very peaceful, you
will remember, when you came. I was living quietly at home
here, without a single desire or curiosity. It was you who
awoke me with words that stirred and roused my heart. It
was you who made me enter upon a fresh youth. Oh! you
cannot tell what joys you brought me at first! It was like
sweet soft warmth thrilling my whole being. My heart woke
up within me. I was filled with mighty hopes. Sometimes,
when I reflected that I was forty years old, it all seemed
foolish to me, and I smiled, and then I defended myself, for I
felt so happy in it all. Now I want the promised happiness.
I am growing weary of the desire for it, a desire that burns me
and tortures me. I have no time to lose, now that my health
has broken down, and I don't want to find myself deceived
and duped. There must be something more; tell me that
there is something more.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas stood quite impassive, letting this flood of
words pass without reply.</p>

<p>'Ah! So there is nothing else! there is nothing else!'
she continued, in a burst of indignation; 'then you have
deceived me! Down there on the terrace, on those star-lit
evenings, you promised me heaven, and I believed your
promises. I sold myself, and gave myself up. I was quite
mad during those first transports of prayer. To-day the
bargain holds no longer. I shall return to my old ways, and
resume my old peaceful quiet. I will turn everybody out of
the house, and make it as it used to be; I will again sit in my
old corner on the terrace, and mend the linen. Needlework
never wearies me. And I will have Désirée back to sit beside
me on her little stool. She used to sit there, the dear
innocent, and laugh and make dolls&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Then she burst into a fit of sobbing:</p>

<p>'I want my children! They were my safeguard. Since
they left I have lost my head, I have done things that
I ought not to have done. Why did you take them from me?
They went away from me one by one, and the house became
like a strange house to me. My heart was no longer wrapped
up in it, I was glad when I left it for an afternoon; and
when I came back in the evening, I seemed to have fallen
amongst strangers. The very furniture seemed cold and
unfriendly. I quite hated the house. But I will go and
fetch them again, the poor darlings. Everything will become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
as it used to be directly they return. Oh! if I could only
sink down again into my old sleepy quiet!'</p>

<p>She was growing more and more excited. The priest
tried to calm her by a method which he had often before
found efficacious.</p>

<p>'Be calm, my dear lady, be calm,' he said, trying to take
her hands, and hold them between his own.</p>

<p>'Don't touch me!' she cried, recoiling from him. 'I
don't want you to do so. When you hold me I am as weak
as a child. The warmth of your hands takes all my resolution
and strength away. The trouble would only begin again
to-morrow; for I cannot go on living like this, and you only
assuage me for an hour.'</p>

<p>A deep shadow passed over her face as she continued:</p>

<p>'No! I am damned now! I shall never love my home
again. And if the children come, they would ask for their
father&mdash;Oh! it is that which is killing me! I shall never be
forgiven till I have confessed my crime to a priest.'</p>

<p>Then she fell upon her knees.</p>

<p>'I am a guilty woman. That is why God turns His face
from me.'</p>

<p>Abbé Faujas tried to make her rise from her knees.</p>

<p>'Be silent!' he cried loudly. 'I cannot hear your confession
here. Come to Saint-Saturnin's to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'Father,' she said entreatingly, 'have pity upon me.
To-morrow I shall not have the strength for it.'</p>

<p>'I forbid you to speak,' he cried more violently than
before. 'I won't listen to anything; I shall turn my head
away and close my ears.'</p>

<p>He stepped backward and crossed his arms, trying to
check the confession that was on Marthe's lips. They looked
at each other for a moment in silence, with the lurking anger
that came from their conscious complicity.</p>

<p>'It is not a priest who listens to you,' said the Abbé in
a huskier voice. 'Here there is only a man to judge and
condemn you.'</p>

<p>At this she rose from her knees, and continued feverishly:
'A man! I prefer it, for I am not confessing; I am simply
telling you of my wrong-doing. After the children had gone,
I allowed their father to be put away too. He had never
struck me, the unhappy man. It was I myself who was
mad.... Oh, you cannot guess what frightful nightmares
overwhelmed me and made me hurl myself upon the floor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
All hell seemed to be racking my brain with its torments.
He, poor man, with his chattering teeth, excited my pity. It
was he who was afraid of me. When you had left the room
he dared not venture near me; he passed the night on a
chair.'</p>

<p>Again did Abbé Faujas try to stop her.</p>

<p>'You are killing yourself,' he exclaimed. 'Don't stir up
these recollections. God will take count of your sufferings.'</p>

<p>'It was I who sent him to Les Tulettes,' she continued,
silencing the priest with an energetic gesture. 'You all told
me that he was mad. Oh, the unendurable life I have led!
I have always been terrified by the thought of madness.
When I was quite young, I used to feel as though my skull
were being opened and my head were being emptied. I
seemed to have a block of ice within my brow. Ah! I felt
that awful coldness again, and I was perpetually in fear of
going mad. They took my husband away. I let them take
him. I didn't know what I was doing. But, ever since that
day, I have been unable to close my eyes without seeing him
over yonder. It is that which makes me behave so strangely,
which roots me for hours to the same spot, with my eyes
wide open. I know the place; I can see it. My uncle
Macquart showed it to me. It is as gloomy as a prison, with
its black windows.'</p>

<p>She seemed to be choking. She raised her handkerchief
to her lips, and when she took it away again it was spotted
with blood. The priest, with his arms rigidly crossed in
front of him, waited till the attack was over.</p>

<p>'You know it all, don't you?' she resumed, in stammering
accents. 'I am a miserable guilty woman, I sinned for
you. But give me life, give me happiness, I entreat you!'</p>

<p>'You lie,' said the priest slowly. 'I know nothing; I was
ignorant that you were guilty of that wickedness.'</p>

<p>She recoiled, clasping her hands, stammering, and gazing
at him with a look of terror. And at last, utterly unable to
restrain herself, she broke out wildly and recklessly:</p>

<p>'Hear me, Ovide, I love you, and you know that I do, do
you not? I have loved you, Ovide, since the first day you
came here. I refrained from telling you so, for I saw it displeased
you; but I knew quite well that you were gaining
my whole heart. Then it was that I emptied the house for
your sake. I dragged myself on my knees, and became your
slave. You surely cannot go on being cruel for ever. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
that I am ill and abandoned, and my heart is broken and
my head seems empty, you surely cannot reject me. It is
true that we have said nothing openly before; but surely my
love spoke to you, and your silence made answer. Oh! I
love you, Ovide, I love you, and it is killing me.'</p>

<p>She burst into another fit of sobbing. Abbé Faujas had
braced himself up to his full height. He stepped towards
Marthe and poured out upon her all his scorn of woman.</p>

<p>'Oh, miserable creature!' he said. 'I hoped that you
would be reasonable, and that you would never lower yourself
to the shame of uttering all that vileness. Ah! it is the
eternal struggle of evil against will. You are the temptation
from below that leads men to base back-sliding and final
overthrow. The priest has no worse enemy than such as you;
you ought to be driven from the churches as impure and
accursed!'</p>

<p>'I love you, Ovide,' she again stammered; 'I love you;
help me.'</p>

<p>'I have already come too near you,' the priest continued.
'Go away and depart from me; you are Satan! I will beat you
if it be necessary to force the evil spirit from your body.'</p>

<p>She sank into a crouching posture against the wall, silent
with terror at the priest's threatening fist. Her hair became
unloosened, and a long white lock fell over her brow. As
she looked about the room for a refuge, she espied the big
black crucifix, and she still had strength left to stretch her
hands towards it with a passionate gesture.</p>

<p>'Do not implore the Cross!' cried the priest in wild
anger. 'Jesus lived chastely, and it was that which enabled
Him to die.'</p>

<p>At that same moment Madame Faujas came into the room,
carrying on her arm a big provision basket. She put it down
at once on seeing her son so wrathful, and threw her arms
around him.</p>

<p>'Ovide, my child, calm yourself,' she said, as she caressed
him.</p>

<p>Then, turning upon the cowering Marthe an annihilating
glance, she cried:</p>

<p>'Can you never leave him at peace? Are you not
ashamed of yourself? Go downstairs; it is quite impossible
for you to remain here. This is no place for such as you!'</p>

<p>Marthe did not move. Madame Faujas had to lift her up
and push her towards the door. The old woman stormed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
her, charging her with having waited till she had gone out,
and making her promise that she would never again come
upstairs to make such scenes. And finally she banged the
door violently behind her.</p>

<p>Marthe went on, reeling down the stairs. She had ceased
sobbing, and kept repeating to herself:</p>

<p>'François will come back again; François will turn
them all out into the street.'</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="XXI" id="XXI">XXI</a></h3>


<p>The Toulon coach, which passed through Les Tulettes,
where it changed horses, left Plassans at three o'clock.
Marthe, goaded on by a fixed, unswerving resolve, was
anxious not to lose a moment. She put on her shawl and
hat, and ordered Rose to dress immediately.</p>

<p>'I can't tell what madame's after,' said the cook to
Olympe: 'but I fancy we're going away for some days.'</p>

<p>Marthe left the keys in the cupboard doors; she was in a
hurry to be off. Olympe, who went with her to the front
door, vainly tried to ascertain where she was going and how
long she would be away.</p>

<p>'Well, make yourself quite easy,' she said to her in her
pleasant way, as they parted; 'I will look after everything,
you will find things all right when you come back. Don't
hurry yourself, take the time to do all you want. If you go
to Marseilles, bring us back some fresh shell-fish.'</p>

<p>Before Marthe had turned the corner of the Rue Taravelle,
Olympe had taken possession of the whole house. When
Trouche came home he found his wife banging the doors and
examining the contents of the drawers and closets, as she
hummed and sang and rushed about the rooms.</p>

<p>'She's gone off and taken that beast of a cook with her,'
she cried to him as she lolled into an easy-chair. 'What luck
it would be if they should both get upset into a ditch and stop
there! Well, we must enjoy ourselves for as long as we have
the chance. It's very nice being alone, isn't it, Honoré?
Come and give me a kiss! We are quite by ourselves now,
and we can do just as we like.'</p>

<p>Marthe and Rose reached the Cours Sauvaire only just in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
time to catch the Toulon coach. The coupé was disengaged.
When the cook heard her mistress tell the conductor to set
them down at Les Tulettes, she took her place with an
expression of vexation, and before the coach had got out of
the town she had begun grumbling in her cross-grained
fashion.</p>

<p>'Well, I did think that you were at last going to behave
sensibly! I felt sure that we were going to Marseilles to see
Monsieur Octave. We could have brought back a lobster and
some oysters. Ah! I shouldn't have hurried myself so if I
had known. But it's just like you. You are always hunting
after troubles, and always doing things that upset you.'</p>

<p>Marthe was lying back in her corner in a semi-conscious
condition. Now that she was no longer stiffening herself
against the pains which oppressed her heart, a death-like
faintness was creeping over her. But the cook did not even
look towards her.</p>

<p>'Did anyone ever hear of such an absurd idea as going to
see the master?' she continued. 'A cheerful sort of sight it
will be for us. We sha'n't be able to sleep for a week after it.
You may be as frightened as you like at nights, now; you
won't get me to come and look under the furniture for you.
It isn't as though your going to see him could do the master
any good. He's just as likely to fly at your face as not! I
hope to goodness that they won't let you see him. It's
against the rules, I know. I ought not to have got into the
coach when I heard you mention Les Tulettes, for I don't
think you would have ventured to go on such a foolish errand
all by yourself.'</p>

<p>A deep sigh from Marthe checked her flow of words. She
turned round to her mistress, saw her pale and suffocating,
and grew still angrier than before as she opened the window
to let in some fresh air.</p>

<p>'There now, you'll have to come and lie in my arms!
Don't you think you'd have been ever so much better in bed,
taking care of yourself? To think that you have had the
good fortune to be surrounded by pious, holy people without
being the least bit grateful to God Almighty for it! You
know it's only the truth I'm saying. His reverence the Curé
and his mother and sister, and even Monsieur Trouche himself,
are all attention towards you. They would throw themselves
into the fire for you; they are ready to do anything at
any hour of the day or night. I saw Madame Olympe crying&mdash;yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
crying&mdash;the last time you were ill. And what sort of
gratitude do you show them for all their kindness and attention?
Why, you do all you can to distress them, and set off
on the sly to see the master, although you know quite well
that you will grieve them dreadfully by doing so, for it's
impossible that they should be fond of the master, who
treated you so cruelly. I'll tell you what, madame&mdash;marriage
has done you no good; you've got infected with all the
master's bad nature. There are times when you are every
bit as bad as he is.'</p>

<p>All the way to Les Tulettes she continued in this strain,
eulogising the Faujases and the Trouches, and accusing her
mistress of every kind of wrong-doing. And she concluded
by saying:</p>

<p>'Ah, they are the sort of people who would make excellent
masters if they could only afford to keep servants. But
fortune merely comes in the way of bad-hearted folks!'</p>

<p>Marthe, who was now calmer, made no reply. She gazed
out of the window, watching the scraggy trees and the wide-stretching
fields which spread out like great lengths of brown
cloth. Rose's growlings were lost amidst the noisy jolting of
the coach.</p>

<p>When they reached Les Tulettes, Marthe hastened towards
the house of her uncle Macquart, followed by the cook, who
had now subsided into silence, contenting herself by shrugging
her shoulders and biting her lips.</p>

<p>'Hallo! is that you?' cried the uncle in great surprise.
'I thought you were in your bed. I heard that you were
very ill. Well, my little dear, you really don't look very strong.
Have you come to ask me for some dinner?'</p>

<p>'I should like to see François, uncle,' said Marthe.</p>

<p>'François?' repeated Macquart, looking her in the face.
'You would like to see François? It is a very kind thought
of yours. The poor fellow has been crying for you a great
deal. I have seen him from the end of my garden knocking
his fist against the walls while he called for you to come to
him. And so it is to see him that you have come, eh? I
really thought that you had forgotten all about him over
yonder.'</p>

<p>Big tears welled into Marthe's eyes.</p>

<p>'It will not be very easy to see him to-day,' Macquart continued.
'It is getting on for four o'clock, and I'm not at all
sure that the manager will give you leave. Mouret hasn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
been very quiet lately. He smashes everything that he can
lay his hands on, and talks about burning the place down.
Those madmen are not in a pleasant humour every day.'</p>

<p>Marthe trembled as she listened to her uncle; she was
going to question him, but instead of doing so she merely
stretched out her hands supplicatingly.</p>

<p>'I beseech you to help me,' said she. 'I have come on
purpose. It is absolutely necessary that I should speak to
François to-day, at once. You have friends in the asylum,
and you can obtain me admission.'</p>

<p>'No doubt, no doubt,' he replied, without committing
himself further.</p>

<p>He appeared to be in a state of great perplexity, unable to
divine the real cause of Marthe's sudden journey, and revolving
the matter in his own mind from a point of view
known only to himself. He glanced inquisitively at the cook,
who turned her back upon him. At last a slight smile began
to play about his lips.</p>

<p>'Well,' he said, 'since you wish it, I will see what I can
do for you. Only, remember, that if your mother is displeased
about it, you must tell her that I was not able to
dissuade you. I am afraid that you may do yourself harm;
it isn't a pleasant place to visit.'</p>

<p>Rose absolutely declined to accompany them to the asylum.
She had seated herself in front of a fire of vine-stocks, which
was blazing on the great hearth.</p>

<p>'I don't want to have my eyes torn out,' she said snappishly.
'The master isn't over fond of me. I would rather
stop here and warm myself.'</p>

<p>'It would be very good of you if you were to get us some
mulled wine ready,' Macquart whispered in her ear. 'The
wine and sugar are in the cupboard yonder. We shall want
it when we come back.'</p>

<p>Macquart did not take his niece to the principal gate of
the asylum. He went round to the left and inquired at a
little door for warder Alexandre, with whom, on his appearance,
he exchanged a few words in a low voice. Then they
all three silently entered the seemingly interminable corridors.
The warder walked in front.</p>

<p>'I will wait for you here,' said Macquart, coming to a halt
in a little courtyard. 'Alexandre will remain with you.'</p>

<p>'I would rather be left alone,' said Marthe.</p>

<p>'Madame would very quickly have enough of it, if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
were,' Alexandre replied, with a tranquil smile. 'I'm running
a good deal of risk as it is.'</p>

<p>He took Marthe through another court, and stopped in
front of a little door. As he softly turned the key, he said in
a low voice:</p>

<p>'Don't be afraid. He has been quieter to-day, and they
have been able to take the strait-waistcoat off. If he shows
any violence you must step out backwards, and leave me alone
with him.'</p>

<p>Marthe trembled as she passed through the narrow doorway.
At first she could only see something lying in a heap
against the wall in one of the corners. The daylight was
waning, and the cell was merely lighted by a pale glimmer
which fell from a grated window.</p>

<p>'Well, my fine fellow!' Alexandre exclaimed familiarly,
as he stepped up to Mouret and tapped him on the shoulder; 'I
am bringing you a visitor. I hope you will behave properly.'</p>

<p>Then he returned and leant against the door, keeping his
eyes fixed upon the madman. Mouret slowly rose to his feet.
He did not show the slightest sign of surprise.</p>

<p>'Is it you, my dear?' he said in his quiet voice. 'I was
expecting you; I was getting uneasy about the children.'</p>

<p>Marthe's knees trembled under her, and she looked at
him anxiously, rendered quite speechless by his affectionate
reception. He did not appear changed at all. If anything,
he looked better than he had done before. He was sleek and
plump, and cleanly shaved. His eyes, too, were bright; all
his former little mannerisms had reappeared, and he rubbed
his hands and winked, and stalked about with his old bantering
air.</p>

<p>'I am very well indeed, my dear. We can go back home
together. You have come for me, haven't you? I hope the
garden has been well looked after. The slugs were dreadfully
fond of the lettuces, and the beds were quite eaten up with
them, but I know a way of destroying them. I have some
splendid ideas in my head that I'll tell you of. We are very
comfortably off, and we can afford to pay for our fancies. By
the way, have you seen old Gautier of Saint-Eutrope while
I've been absent? I bought thirty hogsheads of common
wine from him for blending. I must go and see him to-morrow.
You never recollect anything.'</p>

<p>He spoke in a jesting way, and shook his finger at her
playfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>'I'll be bound that I shall find everything in dreadful
disorder,' he continued. 'You never look after anything.
The tools will be all lying about, the cupboard doors will be
open, and Rose will be dirtying the rooms with her broom.
Why hasn't Rose come with you? Ah, what a strange
creature she is! Do you know, she actually wanted to turn
me out of the house one day? Really, she seems to think
that the whole place belongs to her. She goes on in the most
amusing way possible. But you don't tell me anything about
the children. Désirée is still with her nurse, I suppose. We
will go and kiss her and see if she is tired of staying there.
And I want to go to Marseilles as well, for I am a little
uneasy about Octave. The last time I was there I found him
leading a wild life. As for Serge, I have no anxiety about
him; he is almost too quiet and steady. He will sanctify
the whole family. Ah! I quite enjoy talking about the house
and the children.'</p>

<p>He rattled along at great length, inquiring about every tree
in his garden, going into the minutest details of the household
arrangements, and showing an extraordinary memory
of a host of insignificant matters. Marthe was deeply touched
by the gentle affection which he manifested for her. She
thought she could detect a loving delicacy in the care which
he took to say nothing that savoured of reproach, to make no
allusion, however slight, to all that had passed. She felt,
indeed, that she was forgiven, and she vowed that she would
atone for her crime by becoming the submissive servant of
this man who was so sublime in his good nature. Big silent
tears rolled down her cheeks, and her knees bent under her in
her gratitude.</p>

<p>'Take care!' the warder whispered in her ear. 'I don't
like the look of his eyes.'</p>

<p>'But he isn't mad!' she stammered; 'I swear to you
that he isn't mad! I must speak to the manager. I want
to take him away with me at once.'</p>

<p>'Take care!' the warder repeated sharply, pulling her by
her arm.</p>

<p>Mouret had suddenly stopped short in the midst of his
chatter, and was now crouching upon the floor. Then, all at
once, he began to crawl along beside the wall, on his hands
and knees.</p>

<p>'Wow! wow!' he barked in hoarse, prolonged notes.</p>

<p>He gave a spring into the air and fell upon his side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
Then a dreadful scene ensued. He began to writhe like a
worm, beat his face with his fist, and tore his flesh with his
nails. In a short time he was half naked, his clothes in rags,
and himself bruised and lacerated and groaning.</p>

<p>'Come away, madame, come away!' cried the warder.</p>

<p>Marthe stood rooted to the floor. She recognised in the
scene before her her own writhings at home. It was in that
way that she had thrown herself upon the floor of her bedroom;
it was in that way that she had beaten and torn
herself. She even recognised the very tones of her voice.
Mouret vented the same rattling groan. It was she who had
brought the poor man into this miserable state.</p>

<p>'He is not mad!' she stammered; 'he cannot be mad, it
would be too horrible! I would rather die!'</p>

<p>The warder put his arm round her and pushed her out of
the cell, but she remained leaning against the door on the
other side. She could hear a terrible struggle going on within,
screams like those of a pig being slaughtered; then a dull fall
like that of a bundle of damp linen, and afterwards death-like
silence. When the warder came out of the cell, the night had
nearly fallen. Through the partially open doorway, Marthe
could see nothing.</p>

<p>'Well, upon my word, madame,' cried the warder, 'you
are a very queer person to say that he is not mad. I nearly
left my thumb behind me; he got firmly hold of it between
his teeth. However, he's quieted now for a few hours.'</p>

<p>And as he took her back to her uncle, he continued:</p>

<p>'You've no idea how cunning they all are. They are as
quiet as can be for hours together, and talk to you in quite a
sensible manner; and then, without the least warning, they
fly at your throat. I could see very well that he was up to
some mischief or other just now when he was talking to you
about the children, for there was such a strange look in his
eyes.'</p>

<p>When Marthe got back to Macquart, in the small courtyard,
she exclaimed feverishly in a weak, broken voice:</p>

<p>'He is mad! he is mad!'</p>

<p>'There's no doubt he's mad,' said her uncle with a snigger.
'Why, what did you expect to find? People are not brought
here for nothing. And the place isn't healthy either. If I
were to be shut up there for a couple of hours, I should go
mad myself.'</p>

<p>He was watching her askance, and he noted her nervous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
start and shudder. Then, in his good-natured way, he
said:</p>

<p>'Perhaps you would like to go and see the grandmother?'</p>

<p>Marthe made a gesture of terror, and hid her face in her
hands.</p>

<p>'It would be no trouble to anyone,' he said. 'Alexandre
would be glad to take us. She is over yonder, on that side,
and there is nothing to be afraid of with her. She is perfectly
quiet. She never gives any trouble, does she, Alexandre?
She always remains seated and gazing in front of her. She
hasn't moved for the last dozen years. However, if you'd
rather not see her, we won't go.'<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>As the warder was taking his leave of them, Macquart
invited him to come and drink a glass of mulled wine, winking
the while in a certain fashion which seemed to induce
Alexandre to accept the invitation. They were obliged to
support Marthe, whose legs sank beneath her at each step.
When they reached the house, they were actually carrying
her. Her face was convulsed, her eyes were staring widely,
and her whole body was rigidly stiffened by one of those
nervous seizures which kept her like a dead woman for hours
at a time.</p>

<p>'There! what did I tell you?' cried Rose, when she saw
them. 'A nice state she's in! How are we to get home, I
should like to know? Good heavens! how can people take
such absurd fancies into their heads? The master ought to
have given her neck a twist, and it would have taught her a
lesson, perhaps.'</p>

<p>'Pooh!' said Macquart; 'I'll lay her down on my bed.
It won't kill us if we have to sit up round the fire all night.'</p>

<p>He drew aside a calico curtain which hung in front of a
recess. Rose proceeded to undress her mistress, growling
as she did so. The only thing they could do, she said, was
to put a hot brick at her feet.</p>

<p>'Now that she's all snug, we'll have a drop to drink,'
resumed Macquart, with his wolfish snigger. 'That wine of
yours smells awfully nice, old lady!'</p>

<p>'I found a lemon on the mantelpiece,' Rose said, 'and I
used it.'</p>

<p>'You did quite right. There is everything here that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
wanted. When I make a brew, there's nothing missing that
ought to be in the place, I assure you.'</p>

<p>He pulled the table in front of the fire, and then he sat
down between Rose and Alexandre, and poured the hot wine
into some big yellow cups. When he had swallowed a
couple of mouthfuls with great gusto, he smacked his lips and
cried:</p>

<p>'Ah! that's first-rate. You understand how to make it.
It's really better than what I make myself. You must leave
me your recipe.'</p>

<p>Rose, greatly mollified by these compliments, began to
laugh. The vine-wood fire was now a great mass of glowing
embers. The cups were filled again.</p>

<p>'And so,' said Macquart, leaning on his elbows and looking
Rose in the face, 'it was a sudden whim of my niece to come
here?'</p>

<p>'Oh, don't talk about it,' replied the cook; 'it will make me
angry again. Madame is getting as mad as the master. She
can no longer tell who are her friends and who are not. I
believe she had a quarrel with his reverence the Curé before
she set off; I heard them shouting.'</p>

<p>Macquart laughed noisily.</p>

<p>'They used, however, to get on very well together,' said
he.</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed; but nothing lasts long with such a brain as
madame has got. I'll be bound that she's now regretting the
thrashings the master used to give her at nights. We found
his stick in the garden.'</p>

<p>Macquart looked at her more keenly, and, as he drank his
hot wine, he said:</p>

<p>'Perhaps she came to take François back with her.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Heaven forbid!' cried Rose, with an expression of
horror. 'The master would go on finely in the house; he
would kill us all. The idea of his return is one of my greatest
dreads; I'm in a constant worry lest he should make his
escape and get back some night and murder us all. When I
think about it when I'm in bed, I can't go to sleep. I fancy I
can see him stealing in through the window with his hair
bristling and his eyes flaming like matches.'</p>

<p>This made Macquart very merry, and he rapped his cup
on the table.</p>

<p>'It would be very unpleasant,' he said, 'very unpleasant.
I don't suppose he feels very kindly towards you, least of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
towards the Curé who has stepped into his place. The Curé
would only make a mouthful for him, big as he is, for madmen,
they say, are awfully strong. I say, Alexandre, just imagine
poor François suddenly making his appearance at home! He
would make a pretty clean sweep there, wouldn't he? It
would be a fine sight, eh?'</p>

<p>He cast glances at the warder, who went on quietly drinking
his mulled wine and made no reply beyond nodding his
head assentingly.</p>

<p>'Oh! it's only a fancy; it's all nonsense,' added Macquart,
as he observed Rose's terrified looks.</p>

<p>Just at that moment, Marthe began to struggle violently
behind the calico curtain; and she had to be held for some
minutes in order that she might not fall upon the floor.
When she was again stretched out in corpse-like rigidity, her
uncle came and warmed his legs before the fire, reflecting
and murmuring as if without paying heed to what he
said:</p>

<p>'The little woman isn't very easy to manage, indeed.'
Then he suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>'The Rougons, now, what do they say about all this business?
They take the Curé's side, don't they?'</p>

<p>'The master didn't make himself pleasant enough for
them to regret him,' replied Rose. 'There was nothing too
bad for him to say against them.'</p>

<p>'Well, he wasn't far wrong there,' said Macquart. 'The
Rougons are wretched skinflints. Just think that they refused
to buy that cornfield over yonder, a magnificent speculation
which I undertook to manage. Félicité would pull a queer
face if she saw François come back!'</p>

<p>He began to snigger again, and took a turn round the
table. Then, with an expression of determination, he lighted
his pipe.</p>

<p>'We mustn't forget the time, my boy,' he said to Alexandre,
with another wink. 'I will go back with you; Marthe
seems quiet now. Rose will get the table laid by the time
I return. You must be hungry, Rose, eh? As you are
obliged to stay the night here, you shall have a mouthful
with me.'</p>

<p>He went off with the warder, and fully half an hour
elapsed. Rose, who began to tire of being alone, at last
opened the door and went out to the terrace, where she stood
watching the deserted road in the clear night air. As she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
was going back into the house, she fancied she could see two
dark shadows in the middle of a path behind a hedge.</p>

<p>'It looks just like the uncle,' thought she; 'he seems to
be talking to a priest.'</p>

<p>A few minutes later Macquart returned. That blessed
Alexandre, said he, had been chattering to him interminably.</p>

<p>'Wasn't it you who were over there just now with a
priest?' asked Rose.</p>

<p>'I, with a priest!' he cried. 'Why, you must have been
dreaming; there isn't a priest in the neighbourhood.'</p>

<p>He rolled his little glistening eyes. Then, as if rather
uneasy about the lie he had told, he added:</p>

<p>'Well, there is Abbé Fenil, but it's just the same as if he
wasn't here, for he never goes out.'</p>

<p>'Abbé Fenil isn't up to much,' remarked the cook.</p>

<p>This seemed to annoy Macquart.</p>

<p>'Why do you say that? Not up to much, eh? He does
a great deal of good here, and he's a very worthy sort of
fellow. He's worth a whole heap of priests who make a lot
of fuss.'</p>

<p>His irritation, however, promptly disappeared, and he
began to laugh upon observing that Rose was looking at him
in surprise.</p>

<p>'I was only joking, you know,' he said. 'You are quite
right; he's like all the other priests, they are all a set of
hypocrites. I know now who it was that you saw me with.
I met our grocer's wife. She was wearing a black dress, and
you must have mistaken that for a cassock.'</p>

<p>Rose made an omelet, and Macquart placed some cheese
upon the table. They had not finished eating when Marthe
sat up in bed with the astonished look of a person awaking
in a strange place. When she had brushed aside her hair
and recollected where she was, she sprang to the floor and
said she must be off at once. Macquart appeared very much
vexed at her awaking.</p>

<p>'It's quite impossible,' said he, 'for you to go back to
Plassans to-night. You are shivering with fever, and you would
fall ill on the road. Rest here, and we will see about it to-morrow.
To begin with, there is no conveyance.'</p>

<p>'But you can drive me in your trap,' said Marthe.</p>

<p>'No, no; I can't.'</p>

<p>Marthe, who was dressing with feverish haste, thereupon
declared that she would walk to Plassans rather than stay the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
night at Les Tulettes. Her uncle seemed to be thinking.
He had locked the door and slipped the key into his pocket.
He entreated his niece, threatened her, and invented all kinds
of stories to induce her to remain. But she paid no attention
to what he said, and finished by putting on her bonnet.</p>

<p>'You are very much mistaken if you imagine you can persuade
her to give in,' exclaimed Rose, who was quietly finishing
her cheese. 'She would get out through the window first.
You had better put your horse to the trap.'</p>

<p>After a short interval of silence, Macquart, shrugging his
shoulders, angrily exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Well, it makes no difference to me! Let her lay herself
up if she likes! I was only thinking about her own good. Come
along; what will happen will happen. I'll drive you over.'</p>

<p>Marthe had to be carried to the gig; she was trembling
violently with fever. Her uncle threw an old cloak over her
shoulders. Then he gave a cluck with his tongue and set off.</p>

<p>'It's no trouble to me,' he said, 'to go over to Plassans
this evening; on the contrary, indeed, there's always some
amusement to be had there.'</p>

<p>It was about ten o'clock. In the sky, heavy with rain
clouds, there was a ruddy glimmer that cast a feeble light
upon the road. All the way as they drove along Macquart
kept bending forward and glancing at the ditches and the
hedges. When Rose asked him what he was looking for, he
replied that some wolves had come down from the ravines of
La Seille. He had quite recovered his good humour. However,
when they were between two and three miles from
Plassans the rain began to fall. It poured down, cold and
pelting. Then Macquart began to swear, and Rose would
have liked to beat her mistress, who was moaning underneath
the cloak. When at last they reached Plassans the rain had
ceased, and the sky was blue again.</p>

<p>'Are you going to the Rue Balande?' asked Macquart.</p>

<p>'Why, of course,' replied Rose in astonishment.</p>

<p>Macquart thereupon began to explain that as Marthe
seemed to him to be very ill, he had thought it might perhaps
be better to take her to her mother's. After much hesitation,
however, he consented to stop his horse at the Mourets' house.
Marthe had not even thought of bringing a latchkey with
her. Rose, however, fortunately had her own in her pocket,
but when she tried to open the door it would not move. The
Trouches had shot the bolts inside. She rapped upon it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
with her fist, but without rousing any other answer than a
dull echo in the hall.</p>

<p>'It's of no use your giving yourself any further trouble,'
said Macquart with a laugh. 'They won't disturb themselves
to come down. Well, here you are shut out of your own
home. Don't you think now that my first idea was a good
one? We must take the poor child to the Rougons'. She
will be better there than in her own room; I assure you she
will.'</p>

<p>Félicité was overwhelmed with alarm when she saw her
daughter arrive at such a late hour, drenched with rain and
apparently half dead. She put her to bed on the second floor,
set the house in great commotion, and called up all the servants.
When she grew a little calmer, as she sat by Marthe's
bedside, she asked for an explanation.</p>

<p>'What has happened? How is it that you have brought
her to me in such a state as this?'</p>

<p>Then Macquart, with a great show of kindness, told her
about 'the dear child's' expedition. He defended himself,
declared that he had done all that he could to dissuade her
from going to see François, and ended by calling upon Rose
to confirm him, for he saw that Félicité was scanning him
narrowly with her suspicious eyes. Madame Rougon, however,
continued to shake her head.</p>

<p>'It is a very strange story!' she said; 'there is something
more in it than I can understand.'</p>

<p>She knew Macquart, and she guessed that there must be
some rascality in it all from the expression of delight which
she could detect in his eyes.</p>

<p>'You are a strange person,' said he, pretending to get
vexed in order to bring Madame Rougon's scrutiny to an end;
'you are always imagining something extraordinary. I can
only tell you what I know. I love Marthe more than you do,
and I have never done anything that wasn't for her good.
Shall I go for the doctor? I will at once, if you like.'</p>

<p>Madame Rougon watched him closely. She even questioned
Rose at great length, without succeeding, however, in
learning anything further. After all, she seemed glad to have
her daughter with her, and spoke with great bitterness of
people who would leave you to die on your own doorstep
without even taking the trouble to open the door. And
meantime Marthe, with her head thrown back upon her pillow,
was indeed dying.</p>

<h3><a name="XXII" id="XXII">XXII</a></h3>


<p>It was perfectly dark in the cell at Les Tulettes. A draught
of cold air awoke Mouret from the cataleptic stupor into which
his violence earlier in the evening had thrown him. He remained
lying against the wall in perfect stillness for a few
moments, his eyes staring widely; then he began to roll his
head gently on the cold stone, wailing like a child just
awakened from sleep. But the current of chill damp air swept
against his legs, and he rose and looked around him to see
whence it came. In front of him he saw the door of his cell
wide open.</p>

<p>'She has left the door open,' said he aloud; 'she will be
expecting me. I must be off.'</p>

<p>He went out, and then came back and felt his clothes after
the manner of a methodical man who is afraid of forgetting
something, and finally he carefully closed the door behind
him. He passed through the first court with an easy unconcerned
gait as though he were merely taking a stroll. As he
was entering the second one, he caught sight of a warder who
seemed to be on the watch. He stopped and deliberated for
a moment. But, the warder having disappeared, he crossed
the court and reached another door, which led to the open
country. He closed it behind him without any appearance of
astonishment or haste.</p>

<p>'She is a good woman all the same,' he murmured. 'She
must have heard me calling her. It must be getting late. I
will go home at once for fear they should feel uneasy.'</p>

<p>He struck out along a path. It seemed quite natural to
him to find himself among the open fields. When he had gone
a hundred yards he had altogether forgotten that Les Tulettes
was behind him, and imagined that he had just left a vine-grower
from whom he had purchased fifty hogsheads of wine.
When he reached a spot where five roads met, he recognised
where he was, and began to laugh as he said to himself:</p>

<p>'What a goose I am! I was going up the hill towards
Saint-Eutrope; it is to the left I must turn. I shall be at
Plassans in a good hour and a half.'</p>

<p>Then he went merrily along the high-road, looking at each
of the mile-stones as at an old acquaintance. He stopped for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
a moment before certain fields and country-houses with an
air of interest. The sky was of an ashy hue, streaked with
broad rosy bands that lighted up the night like dying embers.
Heavy drops of rain began to fall; the wind was blowing
from the east and was full of moisture.</p>

<p>'Hallo!' said Mouret, looking up at the sky uneasily, 'I
mustn't stop loitering. The wind is in the east, and there's
going to be a pretty downpour. I shall never be able to
reach Plassans before it begins; and I'm not well wrapped
up either.'</p>

<p>He gathered round his breast the thick grey woollen waistcoat
which he had torn at Les Tulettes. He had a bad bruise
on his jaw, to which he raised his hand without heeding the
sharp pain which it caused him. The high-road was quite
deserted, and he only met a cart going down a hill at a
leisurely pace. The driver was dozing, and made no response
to his friendly good-night. The rain did not overtake him
till he reached the bridge across the Viorne. It distressed
him very much, and he went to take shelter under the bridge,
grumbling that it was quite impossible to go on through such
weather, that nothing ruined clothes so much as rain, and
that if he had known what was coming he would have
brought an umbrella. He waited patiently for a long half-hour,
amusing himself by listening to the streaming of the
downpour; then, when it was over, he returned to the high-road,
and at last reached Plassans, ever taking the greatest
care to keep himself from getting splashed with mud.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight, though Mouret calculated that it
could scarcely yet be eight o'clock. He passed through the
deserted streets, feeling quite distressed that he had kept his
wife waiting such a long time.</p>

<p>'She won't be able to understand it,' he thought. 'The
dinner will be quite cold. Ah! I shall get a nice reception
from Rose.'</p>

<p>At last he reached the Rue Balande and stood before his
own door.</p>

<p>'Ah!' he said, 'I have not got my latchkey.'</p>

<p>He did not knock at the door, however. The kitchen
window was quite dark, and the other windows in the front
were equally void of all sign of life. A sense of deep suspicion
then took possession of the madman; with an instinct that
was quite animal-like, he scented danger. He stepped back
into the shadow of the neighbouring houses, and again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
examined the house-front; then he seemed to come to a
decision, and went round into the Impasse des Chevillottes.
But the little door that led into the garden was bolted.
At this, impelled by sudden rage, he threw himself against it
with tremendous force, and the door, rotted by damp, broke
into two pieces. For a moment the violence of the shock
almost stunned Mouret, and rendered him unconscious of
why he had broken down the door, which he tried to mend
again by joining the broken pieces.</p>

<p>'That's a nice thing to have done, when I might so easily
have knocked,' he said with a sudden pang of regret. 'It
will cost me at least thirty francs to get a new door.'</p>

<p>He was now in the garden. As he raised his head and saw
the bedroom on the first floor brightly lighted, he came to the
conclusion that his wife was going to bed. This caused him
great astonishment, and he muttered that he must certainly
have dropped off to sleep under the bridge while he was waiting
for the rain to stop. It must be very late, he thought.
The windows of the neighbouring houses, Monsieur Rastoil's
as well as those of the Sub-Prefecture, were in darkness.
Then he again fixed his eyes upon his own house as he caught
sight of the glow of a lamp on the second floor behind Abbé
Faujas's thick curtains. That glow was like a flaming eye,
and seemed to scorch him. He pressed his brow with his
burning hands, and his head grew dizzy, racked by some
horrible recollection like a vague nightmare, in which nothing
was clearly defined, but which seemed to apply to some long-standing
danger to himself and his family&mdash;a danger which
grew and increased in horror, and threatened to swallow up
the house unless he could do something to save it.</p>

<p>'Marthe, Marthe, where are you?' he stammered in an
undertone. 'Come and bring away the children.'</p>

<p>He looked about him for Marthe. He could no longer
recognise the garden. It seemed to him to be larger; to be
empty and grey and like a cemetery. The big box-plants had
vanished, the lettuces were no longer there, the fruit-trees
had disappeared. He turned round again, came back, and
knelt down to see if the slugs had eaten everything up. The
disappearance of the box-plants, the death of their lofty
greenery, caused him an especial pang, as though some of
the actual life of the house had departed. Who was it that
had killed them? What villain had been there uprooting
everything and tearing away even the tufts of violets which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
he had planted at the foot of the terrace? Indignation arose
in him as he contemplated all this ruin.</p>

<p>'Marthe, Marthe, where are you?' he called again.</p>

<p>He looked for her in the little conservatory to the right of
the terrace. It was littered with the dead dry corpses of the
box-plants. They were piled up in bundles amidst the stumps
of the fruit-trees. In one corner was Désirée's bird-cage,
hanging from a nail, with the door broken off and the wire-work
sadly torn. The madman stepped back, overwhelmed
with fear as though he had opened the door of a vault.
Stammering, his throat on fire, he went back to the terrace
and paced up and down before the door and the shuttered
windows. His increasing rage gave his limbs the suppleness
of a wild beast's. He braced himself up and stepped along
noiselessly, trying to find some opening. An air-hole into the
cellar was sufficient for him. He squeezed himself together
and glided inside with the nimbleness of a cat, scraping the
wall with his nails as he went. At last he was in the house.</p>

<p>The cellar door was only latched. He made his way
through the darkness of the hall, groping past the walls with
his hands, and pushing the kitchen door open. Some matches
were on a shelf at the left. He went straight to this shelf,
and struck a light to enable him to get a lamp which stood
upon the mantelpiece without breaking anything. Then he
looked about him. There appeared to have been a big meal
there that evening. The kitchen was in a state of festive
disorder. The table was strewn with dirty plates and dishes
and glasses. There was a litter of pans, still warm, on the
sink and the chairs and the very floor. A coffee-pot that had
been forgotten was also boiling away beside the stove, slightly
tilted like a tipsy man. Mouret put it straight and then
tidily arranged the pans. He smelt them, sniffed at the drops
of liquor that remained in the glasses, and counted the dishes
and plates with growing irritation. This was no longer his
quiet orderly kitchen; it seemed as if a hotelful of food had
been wasted there. All this guzzling disorder reeked of
indigestion.</p>

<p>'Marthe! Marthe!' he again repeated as he returned into
the passage, carrying the lamp as he went; 'answer me, tell
me where they have shut you up. We must be off, we must
be off at once.'</p>

<p>He searched for her in the dining-room. The two cupboards
to the right and left of the stove were open. From a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
burst bag of grey paper on the edge of a shelf some lumps of
sugar had fallen upon the floor. Higher up Mouret could
see a bottle of brandy with the neck broken and plugged with
a piece of rag. Then he got upon a chair to examine the
cupboards. They were half empty. The jars of preserved
fruits had been attacked, the jam-pots had been opened and
the jam tasted, the fruit had been nibbled, the provisions of all
kinds had been gnawed and fouled as though a whole army
of rats had been there. Not being able to find Marthe in the
closets, Mouret searched all over the room, looking behind
the curtains and even underneath the furniture. Fragments
of bone and pieces of broken bread lay about the floor; there
were marks on the table that had been left by sticky glasses.
Then he crossed the hall and went to look for Marthe in
the drawing-room. But, as soon as he opened the door, he
stopped short. This could not really be his own drawing-room.
The bright mauve paper, the red-flowered carpet, the
new easy-chairs covered with cerise damask, filled him with
amazement. He was afraid to enter a room that did not
belong to him, and he closed the door.</p>

<p>'Marthe! Marthe!' he stammered again in accents of
despair.</p>

<p>He went back to the middle of the hall, unable to quiet
the hoarse panting which was swelling in his throat. Where
had he got to, that he could not recognise a single spot?
Who had been transforming his house in such a way? His
recollections were quite confused. He could only recall some
shadows gliding along the hall; two shadows, at first poverty-stricken,
soft-spoken, self-suppressing, then tipsy and disreputable-looking;
two shadows that leered and sniggered. He
raised his lamp, the wick of which was burning smokily,
and thereupon the shadows grew bigger, lengthened upon
the walls, mounted aloft beside the staircase and filled and
preyed upon the whole house. Some horrid filth, some
fermenting putrescence had found its way into the place and
had rotted the woodwork, rusted the iron and split the walls.
Then he seemed to hear the house crumbling like a ceiling
from dampness, and to see it melting like a handful of salt
thrown into a basin of hot water.</p>

<p>But up above there sounded peals of ringing laughter
which made his hair stand on end. He put the lamp down
and went upstairs to look for Marthe. He crept up noiselessly
on his hands and knees with all the nimbleness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
stealth of a wolf. When he reached the landing of the
first floor, he knelt down in front of the door of the bedroom.
A ray of light streamed from underneath it. Marthe must
be going to bed.</p>

<p>'What a jolly bed this is of theirs!' Olympe was just exclaiming;
'you can quite bury yourself in it, Honoré; I am
right up to my eyes in feathers.'</p>

<p>She laughed and stretched herself and sprang about
amidst the bed-clothes.</p>

<p>'Ever since I've been here,' she continued, 'I've been
longing to sleep in this bed. It made me almost ill wishing
for it. I could never see that lath of a landlady of ours get
into it without feeling a furious desire to throw her on to the
floor and put myself in her place. One gets quite warm
directly. It's just as though I were wrapped in cotton-wool.'</p>

<p>Trouche, who had not yet gone to bed, was examining the
bottles on the dressing-table.</p>

<p>'She has got all kinds of scents,' he said.</p>

<p>'Well, as she isn't here, we may just as well treat ourselves
to the best room!' continued Olympe. 'There's no
danger of her coming back and disturbing us. I have
fastened the doors up. You will be getting cold, Honoré.'</p>

<p>But Trouche now opened the drawers and began groping
about amongst the linen.</p>

<p>'Put this on, it's smothered with lace,' he said, tossing a
night-dress to Olympe. 'I shall wear this red handkerchief
myself.'</p>

<p>Then, as Trouche was at last getting into bed, Olympe
said to him:</p>

<p>'Put the grog on the night-table. We need not get up
and go to the other end of the room for it. There, my dear,
we are like real householders now!'</p>

<p>They lay down side by side, with the eider-down quilt
drawn up to their chins.</p>

<p>'I ate a deuced lot this evening,' said Trouche after a
short pause.</p>

<p>'And drank a lot, too!' added Olympe with a laugh. 'I
feel very cosy and snug. But the tiresome part is that my
mother is always interfering with us. She has been quite
awful to-day. I can't take a single step about the house
without her being at me. There's really no advantage in our
landlady going off if mother means to play the policeman.
She has quite spoilt my day's enjoyment.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>'Hasn't the Abbé some idea of going away?' asked Trouche
after another short interval of silence. 'If he is made a
bishop, he will be obliged to leave the house to us.'</p>

<p>'One can't be sure of that,' Olympe petulantly replied. 'I
dare say mother means to keep it. But how jolly we should
be here, all by ourselves! I would make our landlady sleep
upstairs in my brother's room; I'd persuade her that it was
healthier than this. Pass me the glass, Honoré.'</p>

<p>They both took a drink and then covered themselves up
afresh.</p>

<p>'Ah!' said Trouche, 'I'm afraid it won't be so easy to
get rid of them, but we can try, at any rate. I believe the
Abbé would have changed his quarters before if he had not
been afraid that the landlady would have considered herself
deserted and have made a rumpus. I think I'll try to talk
the landlady over. I'll tell her a lot of tales to persuade her
to turn them out.'</p>

<p>He took another drink.</p>

<p>'Oh! leave the matter to me,' replied Olympe; 'I'll get
mother and Ovide turned out, as they've treated us so badly.'</p>

<p>'Well, if you don't succeed,' said Trouche, 'I can easily
concoct some scandal about the Abbé and Madame Mouret;
and then he will be absolutely obliged to shift his quarters.'</p>

<p>Olympe sat up in bed.</p>

<p>'That's a splendid idea,' she said, 'that is! We must set
about it to-morrow. Before a month is over, this room will
be ours. I must really give you a kiss for the idea.'</p>

<p>They then both grew very merry, and began to plan how
they would arrange the room. They would change the place
of the chest of drawers, they said; and they would bring up
a couple of easy-chairs from the drawing-room. However,
their speech was gradually growing huskier, and at last they
became silent.</p>

<p>'There! you're off now!' murmured Olympe, after a
time. 'You're snoring with your eyes open! Well, let me
come to the other side, so that, at any rate, I can finish my
novel. I'm not sleepy, if you are.'</p>

<p>She got up and rolled him like a mere lump towards the
wall, and then began to read. But, before she had finished
a page, she turned her head uneasily towards the door. She
fancied she could hear a strange noise on the landing. At
this she cried petulantly to her husband, giving him a dig in
the ribs with her elbow:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>'You know very well that I don't like that sort of joke.
Don't play the wolf; anyone would fancy that there was
somebody at the door. Well, go on if it pleases you; you
are very irritating.'</p>

<p>Then she angrily absorbed herself in her book again, after
sucking a slice of lemon left in her glass.</p>

<p>With the same stealthy movements as before, Mouret now
quitted the door of the bedroom, where he had remained
crouching. He climbed to the second floor and knelt before
Abbé Faujas's door, squeezing himself close to the key-hole.
He choked down Marthe's name, that again rose in his throat,
and examined with glistening eye the corners of the priest's
room, to satisfy himself that nobody was shut up there. The
big bare room was in deep shadow; a small lamp which
stood upon the table cast just a circular patch of light upon
the floor, and the Abbé himself, who was writing, seemed
like a big black stain in the midst of that yellow glare. After
he had scrutinised the curtains and the chest of drawers,
Mouret's gaze fell upon the iron bedstead, upon which lay
the priest's hat, looking like the locks of a woman's hair.
There was no doubt that Marthe was there, thought Mouret.
Hadn't the Trouches said that she was to have that room?
But as he continued gazing he saw that the bed was undisturbed,
and looked, with its cold, white coverings, like a
tombstone. His eyes were getting accustomed to the gloom.
However, Abbé Faujas appeared to hear some sound, for he
glanced at the door. When the maniac saw the priest's calm
face his eyes reddened, a slight foam appeared at the corner
of his lips, and it was with difficulty that he suppressed a
shout. At last he went away on his hands and knees again,
down the stairs and along the passages, still repeating in low
tones:</p>

<p>'Marthe! Marthe!'</p>

<p>He searched for her through the whole house; in Rose's
room, which he found empty; in the Trouches' apartments,
which were filled with the spoils of the other rooms; in the
children's old rooms, where he burst into tears as his hands
came across a pair of worn-out boots which had belonged to
Désirée. He went up and down the stairs, clinging on to the
banisters, and gliding along the walls, stealthily exploring
every apartment with the extraordinary dexterity of a
scheming maniac. Soon there was not a single corner of the
place from the cellar to the attic which he had not investigated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
Marthe was nowhere in the house; nor were the
children there, nor Rose. The house was empty; the house
might crumble to pieces.</p>

<p>Mouret sat down upon the stairs. He choked down the
panting which, in spite of himself, continued to distend his
throat. With his back against the banisters, and his eyes
wide open in the darkness, he sat waiting, absorbed in a scheme
which he was patiently thinking out. His senses became so
acute that he could hear the slightest sounds that arose in
the house. Down below him snored Trouche, while Olympe
turned over the pages of her book with a slight rubbing of her
fingers against the paper. On the second floor Abbé Faujas's
pen made a scratching sound like the crawling of an insect,
while, in the adjoining room, Madame Faujas's heavy
breathing seemed like an accompaniment to that shrill
music. Mouret sat for an hour with his ears sharply strained.
Olympe was the first of the wakeful ones to succumb to sleep.
He could hear her novel fall upon the floor. Then Abbé
Faujas laid down his pen and undressed himself, quietly
gliding about his room in his slippers. He slipped off his
clothes in silence, and did not even make the bed creak as he
got into it. Ah! the house had gone to rest at last. But
the madman could tell from the sound of the Abbé's breathing
that he was yet awake. Gradually that breathing grew fuller,
and at last the whole house slept.</p>

<p>Mouret waited on for another half-hour. He still listened
with strained ears, as though he could hear the four sleepers
descending into deeper and deeper slumber. The house lay
wrapped in darkness and unconsciousness. Then the maniac
rose up and slowly made his way into the passage.</p>

<p>'Marthe isn't here any longer; the house isn't here;
nothing is here,' he murmured.</p>

<p>He opened the door that led into the garden, and went
down to the little conservatory. When he got there he
methodically removed the big dry box-plants, and carried
them upstairs in enormous armfuls, piling them in front of
the doors of the Trouches and the Faujases. He felt, too, a
craving for a bright light, and he went into the kitchen
and lighted all the lamps, which he placed upon the tables in
the various rooms and on the landings, and along the
passages. Then he brought up the rest of the box-plants.
They were soon piled higher than the doors. As he was
making his last journey with them he raised his eyes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
noticed the windows. Next he went out into the garden
again, took the trunks of the fruit-trees and stacked them up
under the windows, skilfully arranging for little currents of
air which should make them blaze freely. The stack seemed
to him but a small one, however.</p>

<p>'There is nothing left,' he murmured: 'there must be
nothing left.'</p>

<p>Then, as a thought struck him, he went down into the
cellar, and recommenced his journeying backwards and
forwards. He was now carrying up the supply of fuel for the
winter, the coal, the vine-branches, and the wood. The pile
under the windows gradually grew bigger. As he carefully
arranged each bundle of vine-branches, he was thrilled with
livelier satisfaction. He next proceeded to distribute the
fuel through the rooms on the ground-floor, and left a heap
of it in the entrance-hall, and another heap in the kitchen.
Then he piled the furniture atop of the different heaps. An
hour sufficed him to get his work finished. He had taken
his boots off, and had glided about all over the house, with
heavily laden arms, so dexterously that he had not let a
single piece of wood fall roughly to the floor. He seemed
endowed with new life, with extraordinary nimbleness of
motion. As far as this one firmly fixed idea of his went, he
was perfectly in possession of his senses.</p>

<p>When all was ready, he lingered for a moment to enjoy
the sight of his work. He went from pile to pile, took pleasure
in viewing the square-set pyres, and gently rubbed his hands
together with an appearance of extreme satisfaction. As a
few fragments of coal had fallen on the stairs, he ran off to
get a brush, and carefully swept the black dust from the steps.
Then he completed his inspection with the careful precision
of a man who means to do things as they ought to be done.
He gradually became quite excited with satisfaction, and
dropped on to his hands and knees again, and began to hop
about, panting more heavily in his savage joy.</p>

<p>At last he took a vine-branch and set fire to the heaps.
First of all he lighted the pile on the terrace underneath the
windows. Then he leapt back into the house and set fire to
the heaps in the drawing-room and dining-room, and then to
those in the kitchen and the hall. Next he sprang up the
stairs and flung the remains of his blazing brand upon the
piles that lay against the doors of the Trouches and Faujases.
An ever-increasing rage was thrilling him, and the lurid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
blaze of the fire brought his madness to a climax. He twice
came down the stairs with terrific leaps, bounded about
through the thick smoke, fanning the flames with his breath,
and casting handfuls of coal upon them. At the sight of the
flames, already mounting to the ceilings of the rooms, he sat
down every now and then and laughed and clapped his hands
with all his strength.</p>

<p>The house was now roaring like an over-crammed stove.
The flames burst out at all points, at once, with a violence
that split the floors. But the maniac made his way upstairs
again through the sheets of fire, singeing his hair and
blackening his clothes as he went. And he posted himself
on the second-floor, crouching down on his hands and knees
with his growling, beast-like head thrown forward. He was
keeping guard over the landing, and his eyes never quitted
the priest's door.</p>

<p>'Ovide! Ovide!' shrieked a panic-stricken voice.</p>

<p>Madame Faujas's door at the end of the landing was
suddenly opened and the flames swept into her room with the
roar of a tempest. The old woman appeared in the midst
of the fire. Stretching out her arms, she hurled aside the
blazing brands and sprang on to the landing, pulling and
pushing away with her hands and feet the burning heap that
blocked up her son's door, and calling all the while to the
priest despairingly. The maniac crouched still lower down,
his eyes gleaming while he continued to growl.</p>

<p>'Wait for me! Don't get out of the window!' cried
Madame Faujas, striking at her son's door.</p>

<p>She threw her weight against it, and the charred door
yielded easily. She reappeared holding her son in her arms.
He had taken time to put on his cassock, and was choking,
half suffocated by the smoke.</p>

<p>'I am going to carry you, Ovide,' she cried, with energetic
determination; 'Hold well on to my shoulders, and clutch
hold of my hair if you feel you are slipping. Don't trouble,
I'll carry you through it all.'</p>

<p>She hoisted him upon her shoulders as though he were
a child, and this sublime mother, this old peasant woman,
carrying her devotion to death itself, did not so much as
totter beneath the crushing weight of that big swooning,
unresisting body. She extinguished the burning brands with
her naked feet and made a free passage through the flames
by brushing them aside with her open hand so that her son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
might not even be touched by them. But just as she was
about to go downstairs, the maniac, whom she had not
observed, sprang upon the Abbé Faujas and tore him from off
her shoulders. His muttered growl turned into a wild shriek,
while he writhed in a fit at the head of the stairs. He
belaboured the priest, tore him with his nails and strangled
him.</p>

<p>'Marthe! Marthe!' he bellowed.</p>

<p>Then he rolled down the blazing stairs, still with the
priest in his grasp; while Madame Faujas, who had driven
her teeth into his throat, drained his blood. The Trouches
perished in their drunken stupor without a groan; and the
house, gutted and undermined, collapsed in the midst of a
cloud of sparks.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="XXIII" id="XXIII">XXIII</a></h3>


<p>Macquart did not find Porquier at home, and so the doctor
only reached Madame Rougon's at nearly half-past twelve.
The whole house was still in commotion. Rougon himself
was the only one who had not got out of bed. Emotion had
a killing effect upon him, said he. Félicité, who was still
seated in the same armchair by Marthe's bedside, rose to
meet the doctor.</p>

<p>'Oh, my dear doctor, we are so very anxious!' she
murmured. 'The poor child has never stirred since we put
her to bed there. Her hands are already quite cold. I have
kept them in my own, but it has done no good.'</p>

<p>Doctor Porquier scanned Marthe's face, and then, without
making any further examination, he compressed his lips and
made a vague gesture with his hands.</p>

<p>'My dear Madame Rougon,' he said, 'you must summon
up your courage.'</p>

<p>Félicité burst into sobs.</p>

<p>'The end is at hand,' the doctor continued in a lower
voice. 'I have been expecting this sad termination for a
long time past; I must confess so much now. Both of poor
Madame Mouret's lungs are diseased, and in her case phthisis
has been complicated by nervous derangement.'</p>

<p>He took a seat, and a smile played about his lips, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
smile of the polished doctor who thinks that even in the
presence of death itself suave politeness is demanded of
him.</p>

<p>'Don't give way and make yourself ill, my dear lady. The
catastrophe was inevitable and any little accident might have
hastened it. I should imagine that poor Madame Mouret
must have been subject to coughing when she was very young;
wasn't she? I should say that the germs of the disease
have been spreading within her for a good many years past.
Latterly, and especially within the last three years, phthisis
has been making frightful strides in her. How pious and
devotional she was! I have been quite touched to see her
passing away in such sanctity. Well, well, the decrees of
Providence are inscrutable; science is very often quite
powerless.'</p>

<p>Seeing that Madame Rougon still continued to weep, he
poured out upon her the tenderest consolations, and pressed
her to take a cup of lime-flower water to calm herself.</p>

<p>'Don't distress yourself, I beg you,' he continued. 'I
assure you that she has lost all sense of pain. She will continue
sleeping as tranquilly as she is doing at present, and
will only regain consciousness just before death. I won't
leave you; I will remain here, though my services are quite
unavailing. I shall stay, however, as a friend, my dear lady,
as a friend.'</p>

<p>He settled himself comfortably for the night in an easy
chair. Félicité grew a little calmer. When Doctor Porquier
gave her to understand that Marthe had only a few more
hours to live, she thought of sending for Serge from the
Seminary, which was near at hand. She asked Rose to go
there for him, but the cook at first refused.</p>

<p>'Do you want to kill the poor little fellow as well?' she
exclaimed. 'It would be too great a shock for him to be
called up in the middle of the night to come to see a dead
woman. I won't be his murderer!'</p>

<p>Rose still retained bitter feelings against her mistress.
Ever since the latter had been lying there dying she had paced
round the bed, angrily knocking about the cups and the hot-water
bottles.</p>

<p>'Was there any sense in doing such a thing as madame
did?' she cried. 'She has only herself to blame if she has
got her death by going to see the master. And now everything
is turned topsy-turvy and we are all distracted. No,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
no; I don't approve at all of the little fellow being startled
out of his sleep in such a way.'</p>

<p>In the end, however, she consented to go to the Seminary.
Doctor Porquier had stretched himself out in front of the fire,
and with half-closed eyes continued to address consolatory
words to Madame Rougon. A slight rattling sound began to
be heard in Marthe's chest. Uncle Macquart, who had not
appeared again since he had gone away two good hours
previously, now gently pushed the door open.</p>

<p>'Where have you been?' Félicité asked him, taking him
into a corner of the room.</p>

<p>He told her that he had been to put his horse and trap up
at The Three Pigeons. But his eyes sparkled so vividly, and
there was such a look of diabolical cunning about him, that
she was filled with a thousand suspicions. She forgot her
dying daughter for the moment, for she scented some trickery
which it was imperative for her to get to the bottom of.</p>

<p>'Anyone would imagine that you had been following and
playing the spy upon somebody,' she said, looking at his
muddy trousers. 'You are hiding something from me,
Macquart. It is not right of you. We have always treated
you very well.'</p>

<p>'Oh, very well, indeed!' sniggered Macquart. 'I'm glad
you've told me so. Rougon is a skinflint. He treated me
like the lowest of the low in the matter of that cornfield.
Where is Rougon? Snoozing comfortably in his bed, eh?
It's little he cares for all the trouble one takes about the family.'</p>

<p>The smile which accompanied these last words greatly
disquieted Félicité. She looked him keenly in the face.</p>

<p>'What trouble have you taken for the family?' she asked.
'Do you grudge having brought poor Marthe back from Les
Tulettes? I tell you again that all that business has a very
suspicious look. I have been questioning Rose, and it seems
to me that you wanted to come straight here. It surprises
me that you did not knock more loudly in the Rue
Balande; they would have come and opened the door. I'm
not saying this because I don't want my dear child to be
here; I am glad to think, on the contrary, that she will, at
any rate, die among her own people, and will have only loving
faces about her.'</p>

<p>Macquart seemed greatly surprised at this speech, and
interrupted her by saying with an uneasy manner:</p>

<p>'I thought that you and Abbé Faujas were the best of
friends.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>She made no reply, but stepped up to Marthe, whose
breathing was now becoming more difficult. When she left
the bedside again, she saw Macquart pulling one of the
curtains aside and peering out into the dark night, while
rubbing the moist window-pane with his hand.</p>

<p>'Don't go away to-morrow without coming and talking to
me,' she said to him. 'I want to have all this cleared up.'</p>

<p>'Just as you like,' he replied. 'You are very difficult to
please. First you like people, and then you don't like them.
I always keep on in the same regular easy-going way.'</p>

<p>He was evidently very much vexed to find that the
Rougons no longer made common cause with Abbé Faujas.
He tapped the window with the tips of his fingers, and still
kept his eyes on the black night. Just at that moment the
sky was reddened by a sudden glow.</p>

<p>'What is that?' asked Félicité.</p>

<p>Macquart opened the window and looked out.</p>

<p>'It looks like a fire,' he said unconcernedly. 'There is
something burning behind the Sub-Prefecture.'</p>

<p>There were sounds of commotion on the Place. A servant
came into the room with a scared look and told them that
the house of madame's daughter was on fire. It was believed,
he continued, that madame's son-in-law, he whom they had
been obliged to shut up, had been seen walking about the
garden carrying a burning vine-branch. The most unfortunate
part of the matter was that there seemed no hope of
saving the lodgers. Félicité turned sharply round, and
pondered for a minute, keeping her eyes fixed on Macquart.
Then she clearly understood everything.</p>

<p>'You promised me solemnly,' she said in a low voice,
'that you would conduct yourself quietly and decently when
we set you up in your little house at Les Tulettes. You have
everything that you want, and are quite independent. This
is abominable, disgraceful, I tell you! How much did Abbé
Fenil give you to let François escape?'</p>

<p>Macquart was going to break out angrily, but Madame
Rougon made him keep silent. She seemed much more
uneasy about the consequences of the matter than indignant
at the crime itself.</p>

<p>'And what a terrible scandal there will be, if it all comes
out,' she continued. 'Have we ever refused you anything?
We will talk together to-morrow, and we will speak again of
that cornfield about which you are so bitter against us. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
Rougon were to hear of such a thing as this, he would die of
grief.'</p>

<p>Macquart could not help smiling. Still he defended himself
energetically, and swore that he knew nothing about the
matter, and had had no hand in it. Then, as the sky grew
redder, and Doctor Porquier had already gone downstairs
he left the room, saying, as if he were anxiously curious about
the matter:</p>

<p>'I am going to see what is happening.'</p>

<p>It was Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies who had given the
alarm. There had been an evening party at the Sub-Prefecture,
and he was just going to bed at a few minutes
before one o'clock when he perceived a strange red reflection
upon the ceiling of his bedroom. Going to the window, he
was struck with astonishment at seeing a great fire burning
in the Mourets' garden, while a shadowy form, which he did
not at first recognise, danced about in the midst of the smoke,
brandishing a blazing vine-branch. Almost immediately
afterwards flames burst out from all the openings on the
ground-floor. The sub-prefect hurriedly put on his trousers
again, called his valet, and sent the porter off to summon the
fire-brigade and the authorities. Then, before going to the
scene of the disaster, he finished dressing himself and consulted
his mirror to make sure that his moustache was quite
as it should be. He was the first to arrive in the Rue Balande.
The street was absolutely deserted, save for a couple of cats
which were rushing across it.</p>

<p>'They will let themselves be broiled like cutlets in there!'
thought Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies, astonished at the
quiet, sleepy appearance of the house on the street side, where
as yet there was no sign of the conflagration.</p>

<p>He knocked loudly at the door, but could hear nothing
except the roaring of the fire in the well of the staircase.
Then he knocked at Monsieur Rastoil's door. There piercing
screams were heard, hurried rustlings to and fro, banging of
doors and stifled calls.</p>

<p>'Aurélie, cover up your shoulders!' cried the presiding
judge, who rushed out on to the pathway, followed by
Madame Rastoil and her younger daughter, the one who was
still unmarried. In her hurry, Aurélie had thrown over her
shoulders a cloak of her father's, which left her arms bare.
She turned very red as she caught sight of Monsieur Péqueur
des Saulaies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>'What a terrible disaster!' stammered the presiding judge.
'Everything will be burnt down. The wall of my bedroom
is quite hot already. The two houses almost join. Ah! my
dear sub-prefect, I haven't even stopped to remove the time-pieces.
We must organise assistance. We can't stand by
and let all our belongings be destroyed in an hour or two.'</p>

<p>Madame Rastoil, scantily clothed in a dressing-gown, was
bewailing her drawing-room furniture, which she had only
just had newly covered. By this time, however, several
neighbours had appeared at their windows. The presiding
judge summoned them to his assistance, and commenced to
remove his effects from his house. He made the time-pieces
his own particular charge, and brought them out and deposited
them on the pathway opposite. When the easy-chairs from
the drawing-room were carried out, he made his wife and
daughter sit down in them, and the sub-prefect remained by
their side to reassure them.</p>

<p>'Make yourselves easy, ladies,' he said. 'The engine will
be here directly, and then a vigorous attack will be made
upon the fire. I think I may undertake to promise that your
house will be saved.'</p>

<p>All at once the window-panes of the Mourets' house burst,
and the flames broke out from the first floor. The street was
illumined by a bright glow; it was as light as at midday. A
drummer could be heard passing across the Place of the Sub-Prefecture,
some distance off, sounding the alarm. A number
of men ran up, and a chain was formed to pass on the buckets
of water; but there were no buckets; and still the engine did
not arrive. In the midst of the general consternation
Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies, without leaving the two
ladies, shouted out orders in a loud voice.</p>

<p>'Leave a free passage! The chain is too closely formed
down there! Keep yourselves two feet apart!'</p>

<p>Then he turned to Aurélie and said in a low voice:</p>

<p>'I am very much surprised that the engine has not arrived
yet. It is a new engine. This will be the first time it has
been used. I sent the porter off immediately, and I told him
also to call at the police-station.'</p>

<p>However, the gendarmes arrived before the end. They kept
back the inquisitive spectators, whose numbers increased, notwithstanding
the lateness of the hour. The sub-prefect himself
went to put the chain in a better order, as it was bulging out
in the middle, through the pushing of some rough fellows who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
had run up from the outskirts of the town. The little bell of
Saint-Saturnin's was sounding the alarm with cracked notes,
and a second drum beat faintly at the bottom of the street
near the Mall. At last the engine arrived with a noisy
clatter. The crowd made way for it, and the fifteen panting
firemen of Plassans came up at a run. However, in spite of
Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies's intervention, a quarter of an
hour elapsed before the engine was in working order.</p>

<p>'I tell you that it is the piston that won't work!' cried
the captain angrily to the sub-prefect, who asserted that the
nuts were too tightly screwed.</p>

<p>At last a jet of water shot up, and the crowd gave a sigh
of satisfaction. The house was now blazing from the ground-floor
to the second-floor like a huge torch. The water hissed
as it fell into the burning mass, and the flames, separating
into yellow tongues, seemed to shoot up still higher than
before. Some of the firemen had mounted on to the roof of
the presiding judge's house, and were breaking open the tiles
with their picks to limit the progress of the fire.</p>

<p>'It's all up with the place!' muttered Macquart, who
stood quietly on the pathway with his hands in his pockets,
watching the conflagration with lively interest.</p>

<p>Out in the street a perfect open-air drawing-room had
now been established. The easy-chairs were arranged in a
semicircle, as though to allow their occupants to view the
spectacle at their ease. Madame de Condamin and her
husband had just arrived. They had scarcely got back home
from the Sub-Prefecture, they said, when they had heard the
drum beating the alarm. Monsieur de Bourdeu, Monsieur
Maffre, Doctor Porquier, and Monsieur Delangre, accompanied
by several members of the municipal council, had also
lost no time in hastening to the scene. They all clustered
round poor Madame Rastoil and her daughter, trying to comfort
and console them with sympathetic remarks. After a
time most of them sat down in the easy-chairs, and a general
conversation took place, while the engine snorted away half
a score yards off and the blazing beams crackled.</p>

<p>'Have you got my watch, my dear?' Madame Rastoil
inquired. 'It was on the mantelpiece with the chain.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, I have it in my pocket,' replied the president,
trembling with emotion. 'I have got the silver as well. I
wanted to bring everything away, but the firemen wouldn't
let me; they said it was ridiculous.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies still showed the greatest
calmness and kindly attention.</p>

<p>'I assure you that your house is in no danger at all,' he
remarked. 'The force of the fire is spent now. You may go
and put your silver back in your dining-room.'</p>

<p>But Monsieur Rastoil would not consent to part with his
plate, which he was carrying under his arm, wrapped up in a
newspaper.</p>

<p>'All the doors are open,' he stammered, 'and the house
is full of people that I know nothing about. They have
made a hole in my roof that will cost me a pretty penny to
put right again.'</p>

<p>Madame de Condamin now questioned the sub-prefect.</p>

<p>'Oh! how terrible!' she cried. 'I thought that the
lodgers had had time to escape. Has nothing been seen of
Abbé Faujas?'</p>

<p>'I knocked at the door myself,' said Monsieur Péqueur des
Saulaies, 'but I couldn't make anyone hear. When the firemen
arrived I had the door broken open, and I ordered them
to place the ladders against the windows. But nothing was
of any use. One of our brave gendarmes who ventured into
the hall narrowly escaped being suffocated by the smoke.'</p>

<p>'As Abbé Faujas has been, I suppose! What a horrible
death!' said the fair Octavie, with a shudder.</p>

<p>The ladies and gentlemen looked into one another's faces,
which showed pale in the flickering light of the conflagration.
Doctor Porquier explained to them, however, that death by
fire was probably not so painful as they imagined.</p>

<p>'When the fire once reaches one,' he said in conclusion,
'it can only be a matter of few seconds. Of course, it depends,
to some extent, upon the violence of the conflagration.'</p>

<p>Monsieur de Condamin was counting upon his fingers.</p>

<p>'Even if Madame Mouret is with her parents, as is asserted,
that still leaves four&mdash;Abbé Faujas, his mother, his sister, and
his brother-in-law. It's a pretty bad business!'</p>

<p>Just then Madame Rastoil inclined her head towards her
husband's ear. 'Give me my watch,' she whispered. 'I don't
feel easy about it. You are always fidgetting, and you may
sit on it.'</p>

<p>Someone now called out that the wind was carrying the
sparks towards the Sub-Prefecture, and Monsieur Péqueur
des Saulaies immediately sprang up, and, apologising for his
departure, hastened off to guard against this new danger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
Monsieur Delangre was anxious that a last attempt should be
made to rescue the victims. But the captain of the fire
brigade roughly told him to go up the ladder himself if he
thought such a thing possible; he had never seen such a fire
before, he declared. The devil himself must have lighted it,
for the house was burning like a bundle of chips, at all points
at once. The mayor, followed by some kindly disposed
persons, then went round into the Impasse des Chevillottes.
Perhaps, he said, it would be possible to get to the windows
from the garden side.</p>

<p>'It would be very magnificent if it were not so sad,'
remarked Madame de Condamin, who was now calmer.</p>

<p>The fire was certainly becoming a superb spectacle.
Showers of sparks rushed up in the midst of huge blue
flames; chasms of glowing red showed themselves behind
each of the gaping windows, while the smoke rolled gently
away in a huge purplish cloud, like the smoke from Bengal
lights set burning at some display of fireworks. The ladies
and gentlemen were comfortably seated in their chairs, leaning
on their elbows and stretching out their legs as they
watched the spectacle before them; and whenever there was
a more violent burst of flames than usual, there came an
interval of silence, broken by exclamations. At some distance
off, in the midst of the flickering brilliance which every
now and then lighted up masses of serried heads, there rose
the murmur of the crowd, the sound of gushing water, a
general confused uproar. Ten paces away the engine, with
its regular, snorting breath, continued vomiting streams of
water from its metal throat.</p>

<p>'Look at the third window on the second floor!' suddenly
cried Monsieur Maffre. 'You can see a bed burning quite
distinctly on the left hand. It has yellow curtains, and they
are blazing like so much paper.'</p>

<p>Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies now returned at a gentle
trot to reassure the ladies and gentlemen. It had been a false
alarm.</p>

<p>'The sparks,' he said, 'are certainly being carried by the
wind towards the Sub-Prefecture, but they are extinguished
in the air before they reach it. There is no further danger.
They have got the fire well in hand now.'</p>

<p>'But is it known how the fire originated?' asked Madame
de Condamin.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Bourdeu asserted that he had first of all seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
a dense smoke issuing from the kitchen. Monsieur Maffre
alleged, on the other hand, that the flames had first appeared
in a room on the first floor. But the sub-prefect shook his
head with an air of official prudence, and said in a low voice:</p>

<p>'I am much afraid that malice has had something to do
with the disaster. I have ordered an inquiry to be made.'</p>

<p>Then he went on to tell them that he had seen a man
lighting the fire with a vine-branch.</p>

<p>'Yes, I saw him too,' interrupted Aurélie Rastoil. 'It
was Monsieur Mouret.'</p>

<p>This statement created the greatest astonishment. The
thing seemed impossible. Monsieur Mouret escaping and
burning down his house&mdash;what a frightful story! They overwhelmed
Aurélie with questions. She blushed, and her mother
looked at her severely. It was scarcely proper for a young
girl to be constantly looking out of her window at night-time.</p>

<p>'I assure you that I distinctly recognised Monsieur
Mouret,' she continued. 'I had not gone to sleep, and I got
up when I saw a bright light. Monsieur Mouret was dancing
about in the midst of the fire.'</p>

<p>Then the sub-prefect spoke out:</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle is quite correct. I recognise the unhappy
man now. He looked so terrible that I was in doubt as to
who it might be, although his face seemed familiar. Excuse
me; this is a very serious matter, and I must go and give
some orders.'</p>

<p>He went away again, while the company began to discuss
this terrible affair of a landlord burning his lodgers to death.
Monsieur de Bourdeu inveighed hotly against lunatic asylums.
The surveillance exercised in them, he said, was most imperfect.
The truth was that Monsieur de Bourdeu was greatly
afraid lest the prefecture which Abbé Faujas had promised
him should be burnt away in the fire before his eyes.</p>

<p>'Maniacs are extremely revengeful,' said Monsieur de
Condamin, in all simplicity.</p>

<p>This remark seemed to embarrass everyone, and the conversation
dropped. The ladies shuddered slightly, while the
men exchanged peculiar glances. The burning house had
become an object of still greater interest now that they knew
whose hand had set it on fire. They blinked with a thrill of
delicious terror as they gazed upon the glowing pile, and
thought of the drama that had been enacted there.</p>

<p>'If old Mouret is in there, that makes five,' said Monsieur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
de Condamin. Then the ladies hushed him and told him
that he was a cold-blooded, unfeeling man.</p>

<p>The Paloques, meanwhile, had been watching the fire
since its commencement from the window of their dining-room.
They were just above the drawing-room that had
been improvised upon the pathway. The judge's wife at
last went out, and graciously offered shelter and hospitality
to the Rastoil ladies and the friends surrounding them.</p>

<p>'We can see very well from our windows, I assure you,'
she said.</p>

<p>And, as the ladies declined her invitation, she added:</p>

<p>'You will certainly take cold; it is a very sharp night.'</p>

<p>But Madame de Condamin smiled and stretched out her
little feet, which showed from beneath her skirts.</p>

<p>'Oh dear no! we're not at all cold,' she said. 'My feet are
quite toasted. I am very comfortable indeed. Are you cold,
mademoiselle?'</p>

<p>'I am really too warm,' Aurélie replied. 'One could
imagine that it was a summer night. This fire keeps one
quite warm and cosy.'</p>

<p>Everyone declared that it was very pleasant, and so
Madame Paloque determined to remain there with them and
to take a seat in one of the easy-chairs. Monsieur Maffre
had just gone off. He had caught sight, in the midst of the
crowd, of his two sons, accompanied by Guillaume Porquier,
who had all three run up from a house near the ramparts to
see the fire. The magistrate, who was certain that he had
locked his lads up in their bedroom, dragged Alphonse and
Ambroise away by the ears.</p>

<p>'I think we might go off to bed now,' said Monsieur de
Bourdeu, who was gradually growing more cross-grained.</p>

<p>However, Monsieur Péqueur des Saulaies had reappeared
again, and showed himself quite indefatigable, though he
never neglected the ladies, in spite of the duties and anxieties
of all kinds with which he was overwhelmed. He sprang
hastily forward to meet Monsieur Delangre, who was just
coming back from the Impasse des Chevillottes. They talked
together in low tones. The mayor had apparently witnessed
some terrible sight, for he kept passing his hand over his
face, as though trying to drive away some awful vision that
was pursuing him. The ladies could only hear him murmuring,
'We arrived too late! It was horrible!' He would
not answer any questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>'Only Bourdeu and Delangre will regret Abbé Faujas,'
Monsieur de Condamin whispered in Madame Paloque's ear.</p>

<p>'They had business on hand with him,' the latter replied
quietly. 'Ah! here is Abbé Bourrette. He is weeping from
genuine sorrow.'</p>

<p>Abbé Bourrette, who had formed part of the chain of men
who passed the buckets on, was sobbing bitterly. The poor
man refused all consolation. He would not sit down, but
remained standing, with anxious, troubled eyes, watching the
last beams burn away. Abbé Surin had also been seen; but
he had disappeared after picking up in the crowd all the
information he could.</p>

<p>'Come along; let us be off to bed,' exclaimed Monsieur
de Bourdeu. 'It is foolish of us to stop here.'</p>

<p>The whole party rose. It was settled that Monsieur
Rastoil and his wife and daughter should spend the night at
the Paloques'. Madame de Condamin gently tapped her
dress, which had got slightly creased, in order to straighten
it. The easy-chairs were pushed out of the way, and the
company lingered yet a few more moments while bidding
each other good-night. The engine was still snorting, and
the fire was dying down amidst dense black smoke. Nothing
was to be heard but the tramping of the diminishing crowd
and the last blows of a fireman's axe striking down a beam.</p>

<p>'It is all over!' thought Macquart, who still kept his
position on the opposite pathway.</p>

<p>He remained there a few moments longer, listening to the
last words which Monsieur de Condamin exchanged in low
tones with Madame Paloque.</p>

<p>'Bah!' said the judge's wife, 'no one will cry for him,
unless it's that big gander Bourrette. He had grown quite
unendurable, and we were nothing but his slaves. His lordship
the Bishop, I dare say, has got a smiling face just now.
Plassans is at last delivered!'</p>

<p>'And the Rougons!' exclaimed Monsieur de Condamin.
'They must be quite delighted.'</p>

<p>'I should think so, indeed. The Rougons must be up in
the heavens. They will inherit the Abbé's conquest. Ah!
they would have paid anyone well who would have run the
risk of setting the house on fire.'</p>

<p>Macquart went away feeling extremely dissatisfied. He
was beginning to fear that he had been duped. The joy of
the Rougons filled him with consternation. The Rougons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
were crafty folks who always played a double game, and
whose opponents were quite certain to end by getting the
worst of the struggle. As Macquart crossed the Place of the
Sub-Prefecture he swore to himself that he would never set
to work in this blind way again.</p>

<p>As he went up to the room where Marthe lay dying he
found Rose sitting on one of the stairs. She was in a fuming
rage.</p>

<p>'No, indeed, I will certainly not stop in the room!' she
cried. 'I won't look on and see such things. Let her die
without me; let her die like a dog! I no longer have any
love for her; I have no love for anyone. To send for the poor
little fellow to kill him! And I consented to go for him! I
shall hate myself for it all my life! He was as white as his
nightshirt, the angel! I was obliged to carry him here from
the Seminary. I thought he was going to give up the ghost
on the way, he cried so. Oh! it's a cruel shame! And there
he has gone into the room now to kiss her! It quite makes
my flesh creep. I wish the whole house would topple down
on our heads and finish us all off at one stroke! I will shut
myself up in some hole somewhere, and live quite alone, and
never see anyone again&mdash;never, never! One's whole life
seems made up of things that make one weep and make one
angry!'</p>

<p>Macquart entered the room. Madame Rougon was on her
knees, burying her face in her hands, and Serge, with tears
streaming down his cheeks, was standing by the bedside
supporting the head of the dying woman. She had not yet
regained consciousness. The last flickering flames of the
conflagration cast a ruddy reflection upon the ceiling of the
room.</p>

<p>At last a convulsive tremor shook Marthe's body. She
opened her eyes with an expression of surprise, and sat up
in bed to glance around her. Then she clasped her hands
together with a look of unutterable terror, and died even as
she caught sight of Serge's cassock in the crimson glow.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
